The movie has a satirical premise with lots of comedian cameos and a loosely reality based success story of the kelloggs staple procuct pop tarts. The story or premise are never the focal point, just elements to start sketch like scenes with over the top acting and comedic lines. The sketches however are never very funny, the few celebrity cameos kind of fall flat and the overthetopness never reaches absurdities warranting so bad that its good status. I was not expecting a bee movie type landing on your feet happenstance but i was hoping for it after the trailer made it look like there was quality comedy involved yet the movie started out weak. But no real saving grace to be found here. Just very mediocre, very flat and unfunny.',\n",

What a ton of fun!! Its packed with incredible stunts - none of them CGI, its funny and charming and exciting in every second. The camera work is flawless, the cinematography beautiful, the casting perfect, the costumes cool af, they have a DOG!! As a fan of the original series, I loved the movie for its celebration of stund craft and its people. Its a beautiful reminiscence to the original. Defo watching it again when it officially launches. God, I love Ryan and Emily. And thank you so much, David Leitch for making this happen. Seriously. Whatever you touch is incredibly fun to watch. Cant wait for the next one!!!!',\n",
       " 'This is a tough one. I liked the concept and the overall story. However i feel like it missed the mark on occasions.The acting was decent. Felt like each character was built upon chemistry and realism. It kept me entertained for the most part.The times jumps at the beginning worked and created suspense. Leaving the viewer unsure of what the history our 3 characters share however, the time jumps became a bit too rapid and i personally found it harder to keep up with where we are in the story. I feel like they could\\'ve left out a few scenes to make the story flow smoother.The soundtrack was interesting. Not sure if it suited the mood of the film. But my biggest gripe is the ridiculously slowed down ending. Not sure what the director was thinking with that one.The conclusion felt like it was going on for 1 hour and i felt it a little cheesy with the last scene of the film.Overall I see a lot of influence from the film \"Match Point\" starring Scarlet Johansson. In my opinion that film was far more successful in what \"challengers\" was attempting.Overall, bit hit and miss. Some decent moments but nothing to get you excited about or talk about after.',\n",
       " 'Everything in this movie is mediocre except the cinematography and the production design. I was looking forward to this due to me really liking Radio Silence\\'s \\'Ready or Not\\'. I was hoping for a fun horror comedy akin to that, but \\'Abigail\\' ended up being as frustrating and obnoxious as their 2 \\'Scream\\' movies. It was however, better than \\'Scream 5\\', but that\\'s not saying much.The acting all round is pretty bad. Dan Stevens is hamming it up, Melissa Barrera is a blank slate, but the worst performance by a mile is from Kathryne Newtown. Newtown has been bad in everything I\\'ve seen her in (\\'Detective Pikachu\\', the \\'Death Note\\' remake), but here she\\'s impressively awful, she can\\'t even scream convincingly. The little girl is good for a child actress, but her dialogue is embarrassing lazy and stilted. She\\'s the exact same kind of \"toying with her victims\" villain we\\'ve seen a million times before, now just in child form.There are TWO 3-minute exposition scenes in this movie where a character just stops the film dead in its tracks, and explains everyone\\'s backstory. It wouldn\\'t be as unbearable if these characters weren\\'t stock and unlikeable, but not one of them has an interesting backstory, so wasting this time trying to \"flesh them out\" ends up being a complete, cliched waste. Theres even a gag where the big \"muscle\" character screams like a little girl, as if we haven\\'t seen that joke a million times before...There were no engaging twists or revelations, and the characters were impossibly stupid. Unlike \\'Ready or Not\\', where the lead character makes smart decisions, and the villains only make idiotic decisions because that\\'s core to their character, the group in \\'Abigail\\' are \"professionals\" who only make moronic decisions to further the contrived plot.One aspect that surprised me was how many loud and amateur jump-scares there were. None of them were effective, and the editing is akin to something you\\'d expect from a horror short on YouTube. The sound design is particularly egregious and insistent, and all but one of the needle drops are total cringe. There\\'s no moments of tension or thrill. I doubt even a 12 year old would find any of this scary.It even uses the same exploding-bodies trick from \\'Ready or Not\\', but in a much dumber and unsatisfying way. It even ends in the same way, with one character saying pretty much the exact same thing as Samara Weaving in \\'Ready or Not\\'. It\\'s just them playing the hits from their one good movie. There\\'s not an original bone in this movie, despite it clearly insisting that it\\'s some fresh, slick new take on vampires.I\\'ve seen a lot of stuff these two directors have done, including their sections in \\'Southbound\\' and \\'V/H/S\\', and it\\'s clear that Gillet and Bettinelli-Olpin only have one good movie in them, and that\\'s mostly due to the fact that the premise in \\'Ready or Not\\' is really hard to screw up. I don\\'t ask for much, I\\'ve seen tonnes of tiny budget, straight-to-streaming comedy horrors that are far more inventive, funny and transgressive than this forgettable chore.',\n",

His last movie, Men, was highly ambitious and memorable but didn\\'t work for me. It was his first miss. Civil War is his second, but for very different reasons.Rather than being ambitious and memorable, Civil War is so normal and bland. I felt bored for the entire runtime, even the action scenes. Why? Because this movie doesn\\'t have a story. It has a premise and does the bare minimum with that premise.The entire plot, which we find out at the beginning, is traveling from point A to point B. And it\\'s dangerous. That\\'s it. That\\'s the whole purpose of the movie. It\\'s also the purpose of a random episode of The Walking Dead. Or The Last of Us.The characters meander. The story meanders. The movie meanders. That\\'s what I just spent two hours watching. A bunch of meandering. And you can throw in some well-shot action sequences. But I just didn\\'t care. I was literally thinking to myself during the climax, \"I don\\'t care.\"It reminded me of another movie that had so much hype and was a huge letdown. Battle Los Angeles was about an alien invasion. Yet the entire focus was a mission to rescue a group of civilians. It\\'s a very regular story with a sci-fi skin on it. Civil War is a very regular story with dystopian skin.Look, this isn\\'t a poor-quality movie. It just has no substance. It feels like nothing. And I had a terrible time watching it.(1 viewing, early access screening IMAX 4/8/2024)',\n",

I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling.

It's a neat story and they made the telling of it fun. Thankfully it isn't goofy. It's not nonstop jokes, but it has a good sense of humor and I heard a good bit of chuckling in the theater throughout the movie, much of it coming from myself.You can tell Cavill had fun with this role. He shows off some range as his character is very different from the brooding muscle man that many people associate him with. It was delightful watching him do comedy. I haven't seen much of Alan Ritchson's work, but it was easy to see why he has such a growing fanbase. He's the muscle in this movie and proves to be a great action star. The whole cast is great and they give us a lot of fun characters.Action-comedies seem to be Guy Ritchie's specialty. He maintains a good balance of action and comedy and works so well with large casts as he lets every character feel like they matter to the story.\",\n",

It's quite episodic in a strange way for the series as well as feeling more oddly polished. In addition it really adds nothing to the character or world that is worth knowing.Outside of the slim and pointless story, Anya Taylor Joy is exceptionally weak casting and while she certainly makes an effort, doesn't come off as hard enough for this type of character (even in the quasi fantasy setting of Mad Max) at all.I do wonder if the fact this is starring Taylor Joy and is a story of empowerment is what's causing the high reviews? I find it difficult to believe a similar unnecessary story lacking the bite of all others in the franchise about such a limply cast male character would garner such reviews.Honestly 3 stars is about right for the movie. It's slim on everything.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m a huge fan of Godzilla, I think the original from 1954 is a genuine classic and a great film (not just a great \"monster\" movie). The Heisei era is my overall favorite, and I thought Shin Godzilla was weird in all the right ways. It was one of my favorite movies from that year.This one might be even better. You actually care about the characters. It deals with some very serious topics, such as survivors guilt and the aftermath of war violence on civilians and conflicting emotions around national pride and feeling betrayed by your government. Yet the film is also exciting and optimistic and has some of the best Godzilla sequences ever put to screen. My favorite depiction of Godzilla is as a force of nature, representing the power of the atomic bomb or the fury of war itself. That\\'s the Godzilla you get here. I think this film can very favorably be compared to American classics like Jaws and Jurassic Park, too.I don\\'t want to say too much, it\\'s best to just experience the movie for yourself. The only part that felt a little false to me was the very end, but I understand why the director wanted to do it that way. The special effects look great for the most part, but there are a couple of shots here and there that aren\\'t perfect when compared to some Hollywood movies. However, it hardly matters. This is an incredible film.9/10 easily, probably closer to 9.5My current Godzilla rankings:1) Gojira (1954)\\n2) Godzilla Minus One (2023)\\n3) Godzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995)\\n4) Shin Godzilla (2016)\\n5) Return of Godzilla (1984)Special mentions to GMK, Godzilla vs. Biollante, Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (1974) and Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964)',\n",

You get so much more lore, and new stuff added that would fit right along with themes from Real Ghostbusters. I can't even really fathom why this is getting negative reactions. I guess post COVID movies aren't supposed to be fun and take the audience on a ride anymore.

I left the film asking myself, \"is this a new story or have we just ignored queer stories for so long?\" I was thrilled to see a movie centered on queer love without the typical tropes of people caring whether the town or family accepted their sexuality. I found myself covering my eyes more than Saltburn at the gore, twists, and energizing perspective on FEMALE POWER. This movie is purposeful in its dialogue and shots.

While its premise is not necessarily unique and it has its fair share of clichés, The Judge is a deeply moving film that showcases the acting powerhouse that is Robert Duvall and the undeniable versatility and magnetic screen presence of Robert Downey Jr. There are also strong supporting performances from Vera Farmiga (she and RJD have great chemistry), Billy Bob Thornton, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Jeremy Strong. I dare anyone who has dealt with family issues not to be affected. Forget the critics - they don't know everything - and do yourself a favour and watch The Judge. You won't regret it.\",\n",

Maybe there could've been some improvements there.Once the 2nd act started, I slowly started to find myself more and more invested in the characters. However, I was still questioning potential plot holes in the story and the films demographic.During the 3rd act, it really tied itself together and started to make a lot more sense. I want to rewatch it knowing how well it ends, similar to a Christopher Nolan film. I'm curious what a child would think of this film because it deals with some adult themes and subject matter that only an adult would relate to. It isn't crude, it's very family friendly. A child might find it slow and boring at times. The moral of the film might go over a child's head but there's plenty of humour and subject matter aimed at children.Overall, I was very impressed with this film, and I'll be watching it again. Take your kids to it. If they don't enjoy it now, it'll definitely have a completely different meaning to them in 10, 20, or 30 years. As an adult, you'll almost definitely enjoy it.\",\n",

It's like 1/4 of four different films rolled into one. The all star cast does the film no favors. Sadly, Adam Driver is a tortured soul and barely delivers. Shia LeBouf character is refreshing only in the sense he is a very good actor. Otherwise the ponytailed guy in pleather is annoying to the third degree. I am still trying to process what the point of the film and ending was. I won't spoil anything but it seems like its FFC attempt to sum up his movie career in some grandiose film. It's all very confusing and the run time consumes you. I had to pause it and come back 3 different times. Did he find a distributor? I guess so. The film won't make back the budget plus marketing. In closing the film and what it is makes me sad - this shouldn't be how FFC ends his legendary film career.2.5 / 10.0 stars.\",\n",

       " \"Before i saw this movie i looked at some people's opinions about it and i saw mostly negative reviews, so i was really nervous going into this movie thinking that i would have had the same reaction to it and seriously i have no idea what those people are talking about. So War for the planet of the apes is the 3rd film in the new prequel/Reboot of the planet of the apes movies. And this is about Caeser going on a journey to stop a war between his apes and an army of highly trained soldiers, while he also tries to control his more violent instincts. First the obvious, the CGI is amazing and is truly a technological marvel to cinema. Andy Serkis once again plays the ape ruler Caesar and is easily the best movie character in recent years, in each film he has gotten progressively better and in this one it is definitely the best performance. The story is great and is well acted throughout. This movie is also an amazing drama. There are a lot of moments that just make you jerk a tear every once in a while and its believable. The action sequences are pretty good too. Woody Harrelson plays the colonel and he does a pretty good job at it (He is not as good as koba but still good). He is just a character that you can relate to and you understand why he is doing all of this. Caesar and the colonel are pretty relatable. As much as i would love to say how great this movie is, i better stop right here. I loved every part of this movie and i did not find anything i did not like about it, but i am gonna talk about why i think most people were disappointed with this film. So if you watched all the trailers and looked at the title you may be expecting one thing, a ton of apes and humans fighting with guns and rockets. But although there is some of that in this movie, its definitely not the main point of it. This movie to its core is about the war that a person faces emotionally while war is happening around him. We see this concept with Caesar all the way through the movie. It also talks about what terrible things a person or people would do in a war. Woody Harrelson's character does what he does because he believes that the entire human race is going to go extinct if he does not act. I mean, would you do that if you knew that you could slowly be replaced by another species? So some people do not like this film because they were expecting a full on hardcore war movie. And it is that, but it really is a commentary about how a person has a war within themselves when war is happening around them. And people either missed, did not care, or did not understand the more darker themes about this movie. But anyway, in the end i thought this movie was a masterpiece in every way it could have been. It has amazing CGI, performances, action sequences, dark themes, tear jerking moments, and a beautiful moral to it. A+ or 10/10 APES TOGETHER STRONG!\",\n",

Director Adam Wingard has adopted this approach when making this film, but on this occasion very little that is being randomly tossed about actually sticks. The smackdowns between the film's creatures are loud, frantic and reasonably fun, but the plot is a sloppy turd of Titan proportions -- a stinky, contrived, overblown mess brought to life in a maelstrom of not very convincing CGI.The script is absolutely terrible, and the majority of the film had me either scratching my head in confusion or laughing at its preposterousness. Kong being equipped with a metal fist is an undeniably cool idea, but the fact that the protagonists just happen to have such a device on hand in Hollow Earth is just crazy (especially one with built in anti-frostbite serum!). A vet who knows how to extract a Kong tooth also knows how to fly a Hollow Earth hover ship -- clearly a man of many talents. God only knows what the Iwi tribe were up to with their glowing pyramids. What was the deal with that glowing spike that nasty ape used to control the ice lizard? And why did everyone suddenly start floating around in Hollow Earth? (there might have been explanations for some of these points, but they became lost in all of the chaos).After Godzilla Minus One, I suggest leaving all future films featuring the big lizard to the Japanese.3.5/10, rounded down to 3 for Kaylee Hottle's perpetually anxious look -- doesn't the girl have any other expressions?\",\n",

On top of that the very cool Celebrity Cameos that prove this director makes friends with everyone he works with in Hollywood.The Japanese back drop was cool not just because I'm an anime fan but because it made the film and the bullet train visual amazing to look at, but Hollywood needs more Japanese actors who can speak English.

       " 'Lucas may have problems as a director and writer, but I\\'ve always thought that those flaws are balanced by his great storytelling ability. The problem with \"The Phantom Menace\" is that he simply has no story to tell. The film merely adds an introductory chapter to a story that has already been told, and stretches it out into a two-hour movie. It is no accident that prequels of this kind are rare. They are very difficult to make properly. And apparently he\\'s just not a sophisticated enough filmmaker to pull it off.For one thing, this project is limited by the fact that anyone familiar with the first trilogy knows the story\\'s outcome, and it therefore lacks some of the suspense associated with a gradually unfolding saga. More importantly, however, this situation leaves Lucas with very little freedom as a storyteller. It also encourages him to gloss over key events; because their outcome is a foregone conclusion, he forgets to bring them to life.For example, we know there will eventually be a romance between Anakin and Padme. So Lucas has the two characters meet here and--surprise, surprise--they seem to like each other. Their developing friendship isn\\'t portrayed that clearly, and their motivations for becoming close aren\\'t explained. Because Lucas fails to make scenes like these believable, we can\\'t help being conscious of how he\\'s manipulating the plot in his effort to connect the two trilogies. Another good example of this problem is Anakin\\'s portrayal as a potential Jedi. There doesn\\'t appear to be anything about this kid remotely out of the ordinary, even though the other characters keep talking like there is. Our only reason for thinking he\\'s special is that the plot requires it.If the story fails to be engaging, it is because we never see the important events. Lucas makes a fatal error in not showing what\\'s happening on Naboo, the small planet whose capture is the focus of the plot. Numerous atrocities are supposedly being committed against the planet\\'s inhabitants, but we only know about this because the characters on screen refer to the events, usually rather woodenly.The deadpan performances are a problem in themselves, but they only highlight our lack of involvement in the story. Think of Han Solo sweating in fear, then think of the emotional vacuums passing for characters in this film. Whenever any of the characters do express emotion, as in the scene where Anakin and his mom part, it still seems awfully restrained. Somehow, Lucas manages to keep the emotional reactions of his characters to a minimum, which gives the film an almost mechanical feel.It\\'s true that \"A New Hope\" never showed Alderaan\\'s inhabitants, but we still could feel the tragedy of the planet\\'s destruction through the horrified reactions of Princess Leia and Obi Wan. Moreover, there were many other involving events which we witnessed directly, such as the slaying of rebels at the beginning; the capture and torture of the princess; and the murder of Luke\\'s foster parents. Furthermore, the major plot elements were intriguing in and of themselves. They weren\\'t there merely to show us how they were to be linked to later events, which seems to be the case with the new film.I suspect that Lucas was not as concerned in the first trilogy with what had to happen later in the story and was therefore able to focus his attention on the events at hand. The weakest segment was \"Return of the Jedi,\" which had the task of bringing the story to an end. Only then did Lucas start to show signs of forcing plot points. In \"The Phantom Menace,\" he gets so bogged down in the task of bringing his story from point A to point B that he ends up with only the bare bones of a plot, and none of it comes alive.This is especially true of the characterization. In the old trilogy, characters like Yoda and Han reveal distinct personalities in their first few minutes on screen. This film goes for more than two hours and the characters, including the familiar ones, come off vague and nondescript. We aren\\'t given much of a chance to experience their personalities in the way they interact. We must take Qui Gon\\'s word for it when he describes Obi Wan as \"headstrong.\" What\\'s most odd is that the cartoons seem better developed than the humans. The scenes where Qui Gon negotiates with the birdlike slave-owner Watto are amusing and well-done--probably the movie\\'s best scenes aside from the stunning action sequences--but they can\\'t hold a candle to the constant interactions throughout the first trilogy.One thing I cannot do is accuse the film of lacking creativity. The design of the creatures, the technologies, and the planets is impressive. Watching the film is sort of like reading a children\\'s book that isn\\'t very good but abounds with beautiful illustrations. There is certainly a \"wow\" factor in the movie\\'s visuals, but the effect of it is short-lived.I get irked when I hear fans talk as though the \"Star Wars\" movies were never about anything beyond special effects. While the inventive visuals are part of what made the originals so revolutionary, they\\'re not what made the films so fun to watch. And in no way can they explain the trilogy\\'s continuing popularity today. After all, many of the original effects look primitive by today\\'s standards, and their novelty has certainly worn off. Only an enduring and compelling storyline could have allowed the first three films to become the classics they\\'re almost universally acknowledged to be.',\n",

Hopefully it lives up to the expectations that are already in place, because i don\\'t think i could handle another stink bomb like Burton\\'s version.Finally......a summer movie that\\'s actually WORTH your summer dollar. Almost every element of this film is pitch perfect. Just what makes this \\'oh so\\' great? Allow me to explain....Judging from the preview, i thought the movie to be a little too relative to the concept from \"Deep Blue Sea\". But this movie takes a much more different route with their Alzheimer\\'s approach. Needless to say, they did a much better job than that movie.....obviously.I know most people may be scratching their heads to this comment, but in my opinion, this is easily the most well written script of the year thus far. It\\'s intelligent, thought provoking, emotional, and damn well entertaining. What makes this so good is the progression of the main ape \\'Ceaser\\' (heh, ironic name), and his journey from a curious and smart ape, into an upset ape that realizes the harsh realities of being treated like an animal. It\\'s now easy to see just why everyone jumped on board when they read this. I kid you not, i actually got goosebumps from this movie, and that rarely happens.And once again, the Weta team did a phenomenal job with their brilliant special effects. Andy Serkis who has already done work like this before in \\'Lord of Rings\\' and \\'King Kong\\', out preformed most actors in Hollywood without barely saying a word. Is it wrong to say that a man in a blue suit with dots all over him, imitating an ape is so far the best actor i\\'ve seen this year? Uh.....not at all. Trust me, see the movie, and you\\'ll understand why.Bottom Line.......not only is this easily the best movie of the summer, i will go as far as saying it\\'s the best movie i have seen so far this year. Yes, it is THAT good. Like i said earlier, almost every element of this movie is pitch perfect. The writing, the acting, the special effects.....all done to near perfection.

       " \"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.\",\n",
       " 'Thank you Hollywood. Yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap, shallow, effect-heavy and redundant remake. The original \"Planet of the Apes\" was an intelligent and thought-provoking movie with a very clear message. It was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue, which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting. This movie, on the other hand, seems to have done away with pretty much ALL the dialogues. Instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie. Dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum, character interaction and development are non-existent and most of the time it\\'s extremely hard to figure out what\\'s going on. Instead, we get a bunch of pointless action scenes, some marginally funny one-liners and some very hollow quasi-intelligent conversations. The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. The make-up of the apes is magnificent, and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too. However, this does not distract from the fact that \"Planet of the Apes (2001)\" is a very shallow and simplistic movie, filled with paper-thin characters, stupid dialogue and a nearly non-existent plot. Please Hollywood, stop ruining great movies by turning them into senseless blockbusters.Oh yeah, the ending did not make ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER.\\n* out of **** stars, mainly for the visuals',\n",
       " \"Among Hollywood's recent output of mediocre (and in some cases: downright abysmal) remakes of Sci-Fi classics, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' was the rare movie which stood out, for it had as much of a brain as it had a heart – plus an original approach to the well-known material and great visuals. Having said that, 'Rise' practically pales in comparison to Matt Reeves' sequel: the upcoming 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is as close to a Science-Fiction masterpiece as a 170 million PG-13 Hollywood summer blockbuster can possibly get.The storyline picks up ten years after we saw Ceasar and his fellow simian escapees seek refuge in the woods near San Francisco, and although the film's trailers already gave away pretty much everything that happened during that time (and alas, way too much of what will happen), I'm not going to spoil anything for those who carefully avoided watching said trailers. As with all my reviews, instead of giving away any details about the story, I'll elaborate on all other aspects of the movie.What needs to be mentioned first is what an astonishing achievement 'Dawn' is when it comes to the use of CGI. I'm normally very critical towards the (over-)use of CGI – but the level of craftsmanship displayed here simply has to be admired. It only took me seconds to forget I was watching digital characters (brought to life through the outstanding motion-capture performances by Andy Serkis, Toby Kebbell and Judy Grier – to name but a few), and I can't begin to imagine what a task it must have been for the artists and wizards in the animation department to work on every background and every tiny little detail of every character until this level of seamlessness and reality could be achieved.But nearly every other aspect of the movie has been realized equally well: Michael Giacchino's haunting musical score fits and reflects the drama on screen perfectly, while the – often terrifying – beauty of the images on screen had me immediately wondering who the DoP was (now I know: Michael Seresin, the genius veteran DoP of such classics as 'Midnight Express' and 'Angel Heart'). When it comes to the action; well, 'Dawn' is not your usual summer blockbuster. This is no light-hearted, comic-book-style fantasy film with fun, over-the-top action scenes. What we have here is a gritty, realistic portrayal of a slowly escalating conflict, and when we do get to the battle scenes in the third act, those scenes are a spectacular, mesmerizing visual feast (and ultimately heart breaking).But the core of this film – and also the reason why the action scenes in the third act really do have an impact and all the mayhem really gets to you – is the intelligent, skilfully told story with its well-drawn, believable characters (portrayed by equally believable actors). The tragic simian/human conflict mirrors our real – and very human – past and present day wars and social frictions in a very credible way and thus makes this film resonate far beyond what any mere Sci-Fi premise would let you expect. So my verdict: With its beautiful imagery, highly relevant story and breath-taking effects, 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is as close to a Science-Fiction masterpiece as its mass-audience orientated constrictions allowed it to be (which – in this case – is very close); an astonishing achievement and highly recommended. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/\",\n",

The only interesting thing that happened to her was Blake, and for those that followed her career we know that Blake was not good for her, and she had more interesting things in her life than being obsessed with that man.She sang with Tony Bennet! And was like the peak of her career!

And Connor McGregor was given far too much (poorly written) dialogue which combined with his vapid delivery takes you right out of the movie.Overall it feels like \"Road House\" was the product of someone giving a 13 year old boy absolute control of a Hollywood production.

The voice narration seemed over the top and unnatural. Felt like the movie was trying too hard. The narration also reminded me of Delores from Westworld.Jenna Ortega and Martin Freeman were okay but the movie wasn't the most captivating. It's a story that's been done before so it really needed to offer something different. But in the end feels pretty unremarkable and you'll probably forget about it as you leave the theatre. I didn't really care much about what happens with the characters and some of the conversations made me sigh and roll my eyes.

       " 'Sure, I was looking forward to getting to watch director Denis Villeneuve\\'s take on Frank Herbert\\'s iconic story \"Dune\". And yeah, I did also enjoy the 1984 version of the tale, so of course this 2021 version was something that had to be watched.And yes, I did enjoy the 2021 rendering of \"Dune\", of course I did. I mean, how could I not? Despite of running for a bit more than two and a half hours, the movie was entertaining and enjoyable. And this was just the first part of the story, so we are in for more.Visually then \"Dune\" was just spectacular, having pretty amazing special effects that brought the world of Arrakis to life on the screen. And if you enjoy CGI effects and great special effects, then \"Dune\" doesn\\'t disappoint.In terms of casted performers, then the majority of the cast were actually nicely cast for the various roles and characters. Now, I am not familiar with Timothée Chalamet (playing Paul Atreides), but he was no Kyle MacLachlan (playing the same character in the 1984 movie). This 2021 version of \"Dune\" also have the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin and Stellan Skarsgård on the cast list. I was really impressed with Stellan Skarsgård in the movie.And while \"Dune\" is watchable and entertaining, I must admit that I was left with a sense of \\'was this really a necessary remake?\\' once the movie ended. And then my thoughts went on to \"will it be remade again in 40 years, with whatever technology is available then?\\'. So there was that whole whether this remake was a necessary thing or not looming over it.And I also feel that the character gallery was a bit underdeveloped, as I felt most of the characters were only given superficial characteristics and personalities, never letting the audience really get to know the characters backgrounds, motivations and such. It just felt a bit too shallow in terms of character development and growth.If you have the chance to watch \"Dune\", then do so. By all means do so, because it is an entertaining movie.My rating of \"Dune\" lands on a six out of ten stars, like the 1984 movie. Sure, this 2021 movie was more pleasing to look at, but of course almost 40 years have done lots to the development of CGI in the movie business.

       " \"The Zone of Interest takes a unique angle in approaching the Holocaust. Certainly an angle I haven't seen before in a film. This different approach gives the film a really sinister quality that frames the evils of the Holocaust in a new and terrifying way.It achieves this approach through stark juxtaposition. It compares the relatively banal, matter-of-fact homemaking of the Hoss family against the utterly horrendous tragedy being perpetrated just over their garden wall. By doing this, it is not an overly graphic or in your face film. Instead, the violence and evil is primarily heard and not seen, as the horrifying sounds of the camp constantly bleed into the Hoss family home. It is in this way that the film makes its mark. To have such tragedy and horror ignored by this family and their guests. To normalise the mass murder over the garden wall. The glib and matter of fact way it is treated by them all. That is where the horror lies.Whilst this is all a very effective way of framing the horrors of the Holocaust, I do think this film lacks any storytelling merit. There is no real plot to speak of, so once the point the film is making has been made it is easy to want it to be over so as not to sit with these evil characters and horrendous events for too long.Then again it is a tricky point because I think this is definitely a story worth telling. Looking at the Holocaust from this angle to understand how normalised it became to certain people is vital to reflect on, but I'm not sure if a feature film was necessary to convey this.So overall, I thoroughly appreciate what this film was doing and the angle it took. The direction is class in creating this juxtaposition and drilling this point home, but beyond it's core message there is nothing in this film to get stuck into. No real plot. No characters you want to understand or connect with. As a result it feels like it overextended itself as a film, but delivers it's message nonetheless.\",\n",

Finally one weekend when I was working until 2:00 a.m. I went home and there was a sequel on late night TV, during the 30 year Planet of the Apes marathon.  It made me curious about the original and I tracked it down.  I have to say it blew me away!The film is philosophical, creative, absorbing and scary.  Excellent commentary on religion and just about everything else. I strongly recommend to anyone who has not seen it.  So far I haven\\'t even been able to convince my friends to see it because there seems to be such a strong prejudice against it and some sort of entrenched belief it must be bad; in fact it is one of the finest films I\\'ve seen and I can see why it is a classic.If you enjoy films that make you think you simply can\\'t dislike Planet of the Apes.',\n",
       " \"Disturbing, eerie, and tense, the first half of Exhuma is an explosive mixture of south korean folklore and mythicism. It effectively evokes the universal dread and mystery regarding the afterlife, and what we, people still living and walking on this earth, can and should do with regards to that. The spiritual and supernatural bridge dangling between the two worlds. It works excellently as a paranormal occult horror film. Great atmosphere, never looses the steam, with fairly memorable moments.But then it reaches the mid point of the film, something happens that made me not exactly sure about how I feel about this film as whole. To be clear: I still did like it a lot and it is nonetheless a strong film, but the aforementioned uneasiness and tension quickly goes away, and never quite reaches the same high as the previous half. It is a reveal/decision that I do appreciate: it is ambitious, creative, and is a big swing that we do not often see in a south Korean film. Also helps that practical effects accompanying it are simply amazing. However, the tonal shift/jarring nature of it kinda turned me off. I do recommend going into the film completely blind!Kinda torn between 3.5 and 4 stars. It the film carried the strengths of the first two acts to the third act, and kept the film more consistent, it easily would've been4 stars and maybe 4.5. Again, still a great film and I highly recommend this to anyone interested in horror films with uniquely korean/asian DNA embedded to it.\",\n",
       " 'Margot does the best with what she\\'s given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I\\'m a crotchety old man, I\\'m a woman in my 20s, so I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m this movie\\'s target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid\\'s movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.',\n",
       " 'Every once in a while the conversation will turn to \"favorite movies.\" I\\'ll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they\\'re too embarrassed now to admit it.I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people won\\'t even admit they enjoyed it. Folks, let\\'s get something straight -- you don\\'t look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic.No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait \\'til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed.This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, \"flying\". \"Iceberg, right ahead!\" The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.The music, which has also been a victim of the film\\'s success, was a key ingredient. James Horner\\'s score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion\\'s pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.I confess, I am a Titanic buff. As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I\\'ve had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity.Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.',\n",

       " 'By January 2022, the book had sold 12 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books of all time. Almost everyone in the theatre, yesterday afternoon, had read the book and were wondering if the movie could be as good as the book, so in my exit poll, of a dozen, or so, viewers, I asked then specifically, \"Did the movie do justice to the book?\" Without exception they said it had. (Although one reader thought the movie had a more definitive ending than the book.) Their ratings were 8s, 8.5s and two 10s. When I said that anything I rated over 8 would be worthy of a rewatch, it was unanimous that all of them would rewatch it, some thinking they\\'d like to read the book, again. So, these people, who came to see the movie, had high standards that they felt were met.The story is simple but intriguing. There is a whole TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD vibe to it. And there is a wonderful contrast between a purity of soul living within a world of threat and danger. It was refreshing to have a film celebrate innocence. The nature shots of North Carolina are breathtaking. The casting is spot on and the performances are flawless. But the success of the film lies with the lead actor, Daisy Edgar-Jones (a very talented Brit, who earned respect for her talents in another best selling novel adaptation for television, NORMAL PEOPLE). There is a wide eyed innocence about Kya that she captures which, in turn, captivates the audience to invest in her story and her plight. (The only disconnect I had with her portrayal was not her fault but that of the production. For a swamp girl, living off the grid, her personal hygiene and wardrobe were spotless and fitted to perfection. A seemingly unlikely possibility considering her environment.) I would definitely see this film again and am tempted to buy the audible book. I give this film an enthusiastic 9 (beautiful and touching) out of 10. {Drama}',\n",
       " '\"In a Violent Nature\" emerges as a visceral tour de force in the realm of slasher horror, a genre that often revels in its own excess. Director Chris Nash\\'s homage to the low-budget \\'80s slashers is both a nod to the past and a savage reimagining for the modern era. The film\\'s narrative, while not groundbreaking, serves as a sturdy scaffold for the true star of the show: the kills. The undead protagonist, Johnny, is a relentless force, his origin story rooted in a tragic mishap that sees him resurrected with a singular, vengeful purpose. The practical effects are a standout, with each kill executed with a level of gore and creativity that pushes the boundaries of the genre. The use of traditional tools of death, such as a hatchet and drag hooks, lends a brutal authenticity to Johnny\\'s rampage. The cinematography is deliberate, with lingering shots that build tension and a camera that stalks its prey with the same predatory focus as Johnny himself. The film\\'s pacing is unyielding, each scene meticulously crafted to escalate the horror until it reaches a crescendo of blood and terror. The performances are commendable, particularly given the film\\'s modest budget. The cast navigates the treacherous waters of slasher clichés with a self-awareness that adds depth to their characters, making their inevitable demises all the more impactful.\"In a Violent Nature\" is not just a slasher film; it\\'s a statement. It\\'s a bloody, unapologetic celebration of the genre that understands its roots and is not afraid to hack its way through the underbrush to carve out its own legacy. With its unflinching approach to horror and a killer who could very well become the next icon of terror.',\n",

For King & Country is one of my favorite bands and they have talked so much about their story during their concerts but to see their story brought to life on the big screen is so inspiring. The hardship they went through after moving to the states was so sad. Joel Smallbone (for King & Country's frontman) co-directed and starred in the film. He is a good actor. It is truly amazing to see that no matter what was thrown at the family, nothing was able to separate them. I don't want to write much more without spoiling the film but I highly recommend the film. It's an incredible story of success, hardship but more importantly how despite all the challenges their faith stood strong and didn't deteriorate due the challenges they faced.\",\n",

Based on Mikael Lindnord, the movie really doesn't offer much besides being the most standard and basic dog movie with little charm between the characters and boring dynamics. Throughout, the production and camerawork is solid as there were some solid camerawork choices and production designs. But that's really about it.The performances were just fine but none of the characters were really funny, engaging nor interesting to connect. At least the dog wasn't CGI. The dialouge is pretty rough, the structure is pretty boring, and realistically, it almost made me fall asleep.Dog lovers will like this movie but everything else, that's all.\",\n",
       " \"My expectations were quite high for this film ... After watching it , I just don't understand what's all the hype is about ? To call it mediocre is to make a compliment ! Slow , predictable , not very clever horror , which is not even a horror , just an unrealistic portrayal of mayhem based on sex... Highly not recommended !\",\n",
       " \"Although this is a typical romcom drama, it feels seminal because it takes Gay movies quite firmly into the mainstream. Yes, we've had many mainstream LGBT films over the years, but they tended to be hard hitting dramas or sad tragedies, with many focusing on the challenges facing the LGBTQ+ community. Yes, we can refer to movies such as the brilliant Pride or recent (not so great) Bros, the sweet Love Simon etc. But this takes it into the fairytale realm: the love between an American President's son and a British Prince, and so, feels that bit different and special as a result.What Red, White and Royal Blue does is cross the final barrier in placing a gay love story slap bang in the midst of the romcom genre that has traditionally been so straight for so long ... too long, with gay characters merely ancillary storylines if included at all. It reminds me of the Princess Diaries, for example, and just has that sense of being groundbreaking because it's firmly a movie that anyone would watch and everyone should. In essence, it is a family film, innocuous and largely innocent like most others in the genre.The lovemaking and conversations around sex were no more and no less in your face than any teen romcom and it was pitched well at a wide audience. It would be an ideal movie for young Gay and Bi people who can see themselves represented unashamedly in a mainstream Hollywood type romcom. In that respect, Hollywood is very late in bringing forward a movie like this and similar have existed for many years in Europe, particularly French/Belgian cinema, and the Irish film Handsome Devil to a good degree.The two lead actors were very good indeed but Nicholas Galitzine, who plays Prince Henry, really steals the show, not just through his stunning beauty but his remarkable acting ability and subtle emotionality which convey such presence that you'd think he was a very seasoned actor indeed. Taylor Perez isn't far behind and also very handsome and talented. They made a very sexy onscreen couple (swoon!) and they should both be very proud of this film, as should the direction and production teams.There is a moment of great hilarity when the elusive King of England finally enters, played by none other than Stephen Fry, and it crossed my mind that he'd be equally comfortable playing the Queen, and I did laugh at the idea that he might have. I'm pretty sure he'd be amused by that.Of course, we wouldn't have films such as these without the original story so much credit to the author Casey McQuiston who wrote the book of the same name. People should credit the author of a story in my view because without them, we wouldn't have cinema and writers are forgotten in many cases, with those who write the screenplay often mistakingly assigned the credit for the story. Lots of people are saying that the script leaves out a large part of the book, certain important scenes and characters and that's a pity that they feel it's not as good as the book, but as someone who hasn't read the book I probably will now and look forward to an even better story.Overall it's higher end for a romcom in production quality and budget and the cast in general are great. There are the customary cheesy speeches and sappy emotion but underlying it is a strong emotional love story that was very touching and I know there will be much excitement in the LGBTQ+ world about this, Heartstopper style excitement. It is justifiable and well deserved.\",\n",
       " \"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.\",\n",

       " \"Watched this recent French film last night; the winner of this year's Palme d'Or, which says something about the level of competition in the world of film today.It's an excellently acted and well-shot story of a wife on trial for the possible murder of her husband, who is found fallen from the highest window of their alpine home, but at 2½ hours, it's a good 40 or 50 minutes too long for such a small and relatively simple tale. There are endless courtroom scenes that don't progress the narrative or lead to any shocking twists, which could have easily been compressed or pared down in more competent hands.It's an extremely - and frustratingly - female film, in its wallowing in subjectivity and its repeated assertion that what one feels is actual reality, rather than the facts of the matter, and as a result, there is no clear ending to the film, the message being that you can choose to believe whatever the hell you like. But of course this is silly nonsense: either one human being pushed another human being out of a window or they didn't, and in a murder trial, that should be all that matters.So yes, it's a strange thing to rate: on a moment-by-moment basis, it's well-observed and often engrossing, but the substance of the story itself is flimsy and, in the final analysis, almost non-existent, so the most I can generously give it is 6/10.\",\n",
       " 'I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie.And this is IT!When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I\\'m sure it will.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years).Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn\\'t really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him \"X\". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.And finally, the scenario/story. I won\\'t spoil anything here; I\\'ll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he\\'s revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can\\'t be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly \"X\", will managed to convince you about that.My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say \"we can\\'t compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick\" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don\\'t live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don\\'t think so. Only time will answer that.This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought.',\n",
       " 'What made this the hugely successful triumph it was? Was it casting, music, imagination, ingenuity, or luck?I remember opening day at the theaters. I was old enough to remember every scene, every character, every nuance of this film; having committed it to memory forever, as if I would never again be able to see this beloved, instantly loved masterpiece.I also remember that the HIT factor of this movie was so unexpected that you had to wait literal MONTHS to get the action figures promised on the cereal boxes. The pieces were still in the manufacturing process and we had to settle for coupons promising our toys in a few months. I wound up seeing this in the theaters a grand total of 36 times; much to my mother\\'s dismay. She loved the movie as I did, but felt I was obsessed. Today, thirty years later, sitting here writing this review, I realize how right she was. I\\'m still obsessed with this movie, and with the subsequent movies which followed. I wait in great anticipation for Episode 3. I\\'m a fan, and I don\\'t care what other people say about Episodes 1 & 2. I don\\'t even mind the \"prequel\" factor, as the situation at the time, dictated to Lucas which movies he would do first.See, I remember the studios saying to him that he had to choose from the three central climactic books, and trash the rest, or just trash the whole idea. He didn\\'t exactly \"sell out,\" he did what he had to do to get his movie...his vision...out there for us to see and experience. I admired his decision then, and I admire it now. Episodes 1-3 are being filmed now, because Lucas had the clout, the money, and the patience to give us his vision...his complete vision and not just the three center books of a 9-book series. I realize that now, there are dozens of books, but at the time, there were nine. And while most of us were happy with Episodes 4-6 and would not have missed 1-3 and 7-9, I personally am so very glad he has taken it upon himself to give us his full vision. I have enjoyed each and every installment with the same sense of awe and joy as I did this one.The casting was the first triumph for this cinematic milestone. Ford is a charismatic and magnetic personality and portrayed Han with a professionalism that you\\'d expect from more seasoned actors. Sir Alec Guiness is an absolute joy as Obi Wan. His casting was precise and excellent in that part. Carrie Fisher portrayed Leia in a way that, up until then, had never been experienced. Most \"princess\" types before her were whining, whimpering, little snots who were incapable of anything beyond tripping and twisting their ankle in times of peril, while Fisher portrayed her character as a bold, brazen, yet sophisticated and educated woman who was aware of her surroundings and capable of defending herself and her realm with the utmost authority.And Mark Hamil. He was perfectly cast as the whining little boy who wanted more, but was afraid to reach for it. He grows up quite well on film in these three installments, and endears himself to the audience so much the more for it. But a cast member who is almost always left out of these reviews is Peter Mayhew. Chewbacca. His character, as a supporting character to Han\\'s, was exemplary. It\\'s not easy portraying a walking carpet, yet holding the attention, admiration, and love of virtual millions. I am VERY happy about his being cast as Chewy in Episode 3. Couldn\\'t happen to a more deserving...or capable...fellow. Bravo! And James Earl Jones\\'s voice being used as the voice of Darth Vader, was pure genius. His commanding voice haunted the dreams of countless thousands of star-struck children for generations to come. I also have to say that this movie would not have had the charm it does had it not been for Anthony Daniels\\' C3P0. He is a gift and a joy.The musical score by John Williams featured in this masterpiece was one of the contributing factors. But honestly, this movie\\'s success was such a total surprise to everyone, including Lucas, that nothing could prepare the world for the aftermath of having witnessed this bona fide legend, first hand.The story itself; replete with sub-plot after sub-plot, rich in dialog and detail, was beyond anyone\\'s greatest expectations. Everyone, including Lucas, expected this movie to fail. It is a timeless classic, which I will not repeat here. There are too many movie reviews giving full details of the plot, and I won\\'t be redundant beyond what I have already said.However, that being said, there are a few points I would like to make concerning the symbolism of this endeavor. The Force is a metaphor for the psychic abilities with which we are all born. It was also a metaphor for hope and faith, dedication and commitment to the greater state of being. The Empire is said to have been a metaphor for the Germanic Nazi \"storm troopers.\" While the Rebellion is said to have been symbolic of (what would later become) the NATO forces who defeated them.And then there are the effects. The effects were, in 1977, so awesome; so creative; so ahead of their time, as to ensure this movie\\'s vast success for the next forty years. George Lucas enjoys an almost god-like status among sci-fi/fantasy fans worldwide.This movie does not rate a rating. Usually, when I say that, it is because the movie is so bad, or disappointing that I don\\'t have the heart to rate it. But in this case, it far surpasses any 10/10 rating I could give it.The Fiend :.',\n",
       " 'Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don\\'t like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn\\'t care much for her debut outing, \"Promising Young Woman\" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, \"Saltburn.\" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn\\'t care less. (Think \"The Killing of a Sacred Deer\" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep\\'s clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It\\'s the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one\\'s watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What\\'s more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it\\'s a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there\\'s the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who\\'s quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director\\'s cinematic predecessor attempted to do. Save your money, and don\\'t waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker.',\n",

       " 'In the past few years, I haven\\'t really been big with Disney\\'s recent animated movies as while I did like \"Soul\" and \"Raya and the Last Dragon\", the other works like \"Luca, Encanto, Lightyear, Strange World, Elemental and Turning Red\" I wasn\\'t really big on. \"Wish\", being the 100th Anniversary for Disney, manages to be bland and boring at its best.Throughout, the animation is solid as there are some good colors, solid structures and designs. There are some good musical instrumental backgrounds as well. I do appreciate that the story isn\\'t based on a sequel, remake or something that already exists and Disney tries to introduce new characters and settings. But the issue is that the narrative is way too familiar from other stories and it lacks the creativity, energy and charm of the good old Disney princess movies which makes it pretty difficult to fully engage with emotionally or to care for. The lack of energy and bland style causes the characters to not be investing as well since none of the characters were engaging or interesting at all. However, the voice performances from the cast members are pretty good. Ariana DeBose and Chris Pine both provided really good voice performances. Including Alan Tudyk as Tudyk is great as usual with his voice works.The animation, as I mentioned, it\\'s solid as the design models, colors, and movements are pretty good. With the animation using a mix of computer and watercolor, there are some really nice moments but admittedly, there were some animated movements or looks that felt odd, bland and slightly distracting. The dialogue is pretty clunky, the direction was boring, and the singing or musical moments, despite one or two songs being not too bad, the singing and song-writing wasn\\'t good as some of the sound felt like it was written from AI. Like some of the voice and singing sound effects were pretty off. And as a whole, it was mostly boring.For this being the 100th Anniversary movie for Disney, it\\'s quite embarrassing since there could have been any other movie that could have been pretty fun and all but it seemed Disney decided to go with the bland route.Overall, children and families will be entertained but this one is definitely one of Disney\\'s weaker movies.',\n",

Ridiculously over complicated plot with about four separate strand running at once, none of which were really resolved satisfactorily, and a couple of them not at all.

       " 'Yes, the movie about the guy cleaning toilets in Japan for two hours is up there among the best of 2023. I was worried it might be boring, but once the routine of the protagonist is established, there are gradually more dramatic elements revealed, and I feel like the whole film is about finding happiness or at least some level of contentment in the mundane. That gives it a similarity to Paterson, but I feel like it\\'s really only the first half of Perfect Days that feels super comparable; there are added elements here in the second half that help the two feel different.Wim Wenders loves driving, he loves Japan, and he loves great music, and you get a lot of all three here. I think it\\'s my favorite film of his besides the epic Until the End of the World (also partly set in Japan, also with much driving, and also with a killer soundtrack), but there are many films of his I should revisit, because I might\\'ve been too young for them when I did watch them (Paris, Texas comes to mind).If you\\'re able to settle into a groove the same way the main character does here, I think Perfect Days ends up being surprisingly engrossing for most of its runtime. I was glad to see it in a cinema, and without any distractions. Parts of it also reminded me of Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles, but that one\\'s more provocative in highlighting boredom, and wants to wear the viewer down to make them feel the plight of the titular character. Perfect Days gives you 12 days (I counted) in the life of someone who has a profession that sounds boring, but captures small moments throughout nearly two weeks in this guy\\'s life that show happiness and beauty with his lifestyle.I liked spending time with this character, I loved how the film looked and sounded music-wise, and I appreciated all the quiet yet touching moments; some of them funny, and some of them sad. I don\\'t know if Perfect Days is for everyone, and it might not have even been for me, had I watched it on a different day or in different circumstances. But all I know is that it hit the spot today, and that\\'s all that matters today. \"Now is now,\" as they say in the film itself.',\n",
       " '...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I\\'m 25 years old, and I\\'ve read \"The Lord of the Rings\" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Silmarillion\" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo\\'s table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in \"The Hobbit\" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron. Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of \\'Fellowship of the Ring\\' lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? I\\'ve read a reviewer saying he\\'d make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with \\'Alvin and the Chimpmunks\\' kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least.Ok, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jackson\\'s vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson\\'s, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; that\\'s the thing with books: each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried \"ranger\". Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, he\\'s willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the \\'best friend\\' everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can\\'t wait for his return.Quite frankly, I can\\'t wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, I\\'ll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25¢ novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure.',\n",

The film features no highbrow intellectual conversations but instead, favors the same lines you\\'ve probably slung at your lovers. Again and again and again.

Such is the case with writer-director Andrew Haigh\\'s latest offering, a heartwarming and heartbreaking story of love, reflection and healing all rolled into one. To say too much about the film would invariably lead to a plethora of spoilers, but suffice it to say that it tells a genuinely moving and touching tale of a 30-something gay Londoner (Andrew Scott) and his budding relationship with a mysterious new beau (Paul Mescal), an involvement very much influenced by the protagonist\\'s relationship with his own past, most notably his involvement with his parents (Jamie Bell, Claire Foy). This is one of those pictures that\\'s just about perfect in virtually every regard thanks to its stringent adherence to authenticity in the writing and the portrayals of its positively stellar cast, especially the highly underrated performance by Foy, whose role has puzzlingly been flying under the radar thus far. It\\'s also a production that will likely surprise viewers in myriad ways, defying expectations and telling a story that\\'s anything but apparent from what\\'s in its promotional trailer. Moreover, I\\'m impressed by the fact that this is an offering featuring gay characters in which their sexuality is not the principal focus of the narrative, something that truly distinguishes this feature from so many others in this genre. Add to these attributes a sensitively chosen soundtrack and some surprisingly innovative cinematography, and you\\'ve got one helluva fine movie. To be sure, this is one of those releases that, if it doesn\\'t touch you profoundly, you\\'d better check to see if you have ice water coursing through your veins. \"All of Us Strangers\" richly deserves whatever accolades it receives.

Yet without such scenes, \"Pulp Fiction\" wouldn\\'t be \"Pulp Fiction.\" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It\\'s no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won\\'t pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. \"Pulp Fiction,\" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or \"art about art.\" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I\\'ve ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it\\'s essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino\\'s originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, \"Be cool and no one\\'s going to get hurt,\" which is just the type of line you\\'d find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren\\'t just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia\\'s statement to Vincent, \"That\\'s when you know you\\'ve found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.\"What is the movie\\'s purpose exactly? I\\'m not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn\\'t just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it\\'s a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There\\'s a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch\\'s act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we\\'re never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, it\\'s hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really \"about\" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn\\'t need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.',\n",

       " \"Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan's Inception, this really is not possible.This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus. I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness.I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didn't like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is just so hard not too.If you liked this review check out my new film blog: http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com\",\n",
       " \"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there.\",\n",
       " \"GREAT VALUES, LOVELY STORY, NO EXPLICIT THEMES!! I honestly took a step back when I first saw this. I am ALWAYS extremely critical of movies lately, especially since recently Illumination, Disney, and even a recent Dreamworks movie have fallen flat, but wow!This is truly a family film that is appealing to ALL audiences. Kids have laughs at gags, adults have entertainment from parenting and general themes, and they even poke fun at grandparents, who still are made out to be cool and fun-loving by the end.From both a filmmaker and huge movie fan's perspective, it is extremely refreshing to see a kids movie have good values, no explicit themes, and still be very entertaining! The story and plot was well worked out and everything made sense. The music was fantastic (a solid original score, no spammed pop music like most kids movies). The animation was adorable and very enjoyable to watch. It was also super refreshing to see new/underground talents showcased! A lot of less known names but a fantastic job done (especially the voice actors)!I'm really impressed and wish to express from the bottom of my heart, thank you for making such a great family film, creating a safe space for families to enjoy a movie without oversexualized themed, over the top toilet humor, extreme violence, etc. 9/10!!!\",\n",
       " 'I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like \"The Phantom Menace,\" I\\'ve had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was \"How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?\" rather than \"How entertaining is this film overall?\" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I\\'ll never know how I\\'d have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.Critics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I\\'d have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children\\'s movies, like \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Mary Poppins,\" are so successful partly because they\\'re so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children\\'s movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they\\'re based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children\\'s book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That\\'s why it\\'s easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don\\'t have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It\\'s as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, \"Adventures in Babysitting\"), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don\\'t. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that\\'s exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry\\'s two best friends are flawless.I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children\\'s delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry\\'s swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like \"Home Alone\" and \"Mrs. Doubtfire.\" Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors\\' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.But much is left out. Harry\\'s caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren\\'t in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--\"Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers\"--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn\\'t as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.Not that I\\'m blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.The problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling\\'s series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary \"muggle\" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you\\'re left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.Although the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I\\'ve never seen happen before, though I don\\'t go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn\\'t have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn\\'t really trying to get involved in the movie\\'s story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.The answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry\\'s anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he\\'s kicked out, he\\'ll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn\\'t tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry\\'s adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn\\'t enough tying them all together.What we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children\\'s series, but it doesn\\'t entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book\\'s delights to the screen. In its current form, it\\'s almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling\\'s series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing.',\n",

       " 'When it comes to naming the best films of the 1990\\'s, The Talented Mr. Ripley hardly ever gets a mention. This is one of cinema\\'s greatest mysteries; how can a film as well made, constantly intriguing and brilliantly conceived as this one constantly get passed over? And in favour of many under deserving films as well? Really strange. Almost as big a mystery as the one I\\'ve just mentioned is the web of intrigue created here. Through deep, complex characters and situations rich with double meaning, Anthony Minghella has turned Patricia Highsmith\\'s original novel into a cinematic masterpiece. The talented Matt Damon stars as the talented man of the title that is offered $1000 to travel to Italy to try and return Dickie; the rich and spoilt son of a millionaire. What follows is a complex, disturbing and fascinating expose of a man ingratiating himself into the lives of Dickie, his girlfriend Marge and high society on the whole...The main reason why The Talented Mr. Ripley works so well is that it\\'s central characters are deep labyrinths that beg to explored and analysed. Every scene is rich with double meaning and character interactions that exist under the surface of the drama we are seeing on screen. The character of Tom Ripley is a true masterpiece of characterisation indeed. This sociopath, that would rather be \"a pretend somebody than a real nobody\" is a myriad of contradictions and muddled personalities. His actions are always amoral and through his lies and deception, it is obvious that he doesn\\'t care at all for anyone around him. However, despite this; we are still able to feel for him through his tribulations. The story is told in such a way that it is difficult to feel for any of the other characters and all of our sympathies lie with the talented Tom Ripley. This puts the audience in a strange situation, as we\\'re used to hating the antagonist and feeling for the protagonist, but this film turns that on it\\'s head, and to great effect.The film is helped implicitly by the fact that it\\'s one of the most professionally made films ever to make it onto the screen. Every scene, every action, every line uttered is done with the greatest assurance and nothing at all in the film appears to be there by accident or out of place. The way that the characters interact with each other and their surroundings is always believable and we never question anything that is shown on screen. Anthony Minghella\\'s direction is more than solid, and this is helped by the stunning photography, courtesy of 1950\\'s Italy. Many a film has benefited from Italy\\'s landscape, and this is one of them. This is all great, but it\\'s the performances that put the final finishing touch on this amazing masterclass of film-making. As mentioned, the talented Mr Damon takes the lead role and completely makes it his own. He often gets coupled with his friend, Ben Afleck, when it comes to acting; but this is very unfair as Damon is one of today\\'s brightest stars. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow make up the other two leads. I\\'m not the biggest fan of either of these two stars, but both, like Damon, give performances here that will always be associated with their personalities. Cate Blanchett has a small role, but the real plaudits for the smaller performances go to the brilliant Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who steals every scene he\\'s in.The Talented Mr. Ripley is one stunning piece of film. Ignore the people that don\\'t consider this one of the 1990\\'s greatest achievements; they are wrong. The film is a masterpiece of tense situations, great characterisation and professional film-making. And I refuse to hear otherwise.',\n",

Not to criticize, I liked the time setting. It added a bit of magic. At least for me. Summary. Bottom line. It was okay, but I was expecting a little more. A little more depth to the story. I missed some revelation or explanation. For me, an above average horror film that I would only recommend to fans of the genre.\",\n",

It feels like a worthy successor to the original film, it doesn't just ignore the past, it supports it. I would advise seeing the original movie ahead of this, as there is a lot of nostalgia surrounding it. I feel like they wanted it to respect the original, that it does.Some really nice special effects, a few perhaps not so good, but that's just me being picky. A good atmosphere, and a really good pace, there's nothing slow about the film, it doesn't lull, nor did it feel overlong. It's a bit goofy, it doesn't take itself too seriously.Great to see some old, familiar faces, if you're a fan of the original, you really will love the nostalgia vibe.

       " 'What\\'s that you say? Ghostbusters, one of the most financially successful and over-hyped comedies of the eighties, underrated? Yes. Precicely because it was so over-hyped and made so much money, there has been a stigma attached to this film identifying it as a childish FX piece, when it is nothing of the sort. Most of the lines people remember(\"He slimed me,\" \"OK. So? She\\'s a dog,\" \"When someone asks you if you\\'re a god, you say YES!\") are not its funniest or wittiest lines, which often are missed on first or even second viewing. I laugh every time I observe a gag or a quip that I somehow missed the other 20 times I viewed a scene; \"Egon, this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole through your head, remember that?\" \"That would have worked if you hadn\\'t stopped me\", or, to the driver of a van from a loony bin, \"Dropping off or picking up?\" Brilliant.Not only is Ghostbusters funny, it manages to include some truly scary scenes. And not just lose-your-popcorn moments like the fridge from Hell, but also scenes of quiet, thoughtful chill, like Egon\\'s retelling of how the possessed apartment building came into being, or Winston recalling the Book of Revelation. Which other film has managed to combine the Marx Brothers with HP Lovecraft?The special effects hold up well, besides some obvious studio sets and models, but what really creates this film\\'s world is the stunning cinematography. Manhattan, perhaps the pinnacle of Gothic architectural evolution, is brilliantly utilised here to create a sense of menacing grandeur. After watching \"Ghostbusters\" I couldn\\'t imagine the realm of the Old Gods opening into our world from anywhere else. The soundtrack is great, not the overrated theme (Which was in fact lifted from Huey Lewis\\' \"I Need a New Drug\"), but the wonderfully blusey \"Cleaning Up the Town,\" the creepy proto-techno chiller \"Magic\" and also the wonderful score by the late and much lamented Elmer Bernstein.',\n",

       " \"Saying that this film starts where `Two Towers' left off is somewhat misleading, for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helm's Deep. `Return of the King' opens with a flashback of Smeagol (Andy Serkis) obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of `Two Towers,' at that's the ring. The first installment, `The Fellowship of the Ring,' provided heaps of exposition on the ring's importance and influence, and in `Return of the King,' we see it pay off, big time.After the armies of Isengard have been defeated due to an allegiance between Theoden (Bernard Hill), the king of Rohan, and the elves, the main threat to middle earth is now concentrated in the kingdom of Mordor, controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron has turned his eye towards the realm of Gondor, the last free kingdom of men, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) must warn Denethor (John Noble), Steward of Gondor of the impending attack, while Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), heir to the throne of Gondor, and Theoden gather men to aid against the armies of Mordor. The dark lord Sauron needs only to regain the one ring of power to conquer all of middle earth, and two hobbits, Frodo (Elijah Wood) the ring-bearer and Sam (Sean Astin), must continue their journey, directed by Gollum, to Mount Doom, the only place where the ring can be destroyed. Got all that? If not, you need to bone up on your `Lord of the Rings' before expecting to follow this film.Since all three epics were filmed simultaneously, each individually has the feel of being part of a larger picture - except for this one. `The Return of the King' is just too big, the most epic of a set of epic films. Now that director Peter Jackson has brilliantly constructed the characters and plotlines throughout the first two films, he puts them to use.All of the characters have their best moments within this film. The pair of mischievous hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), are no longer the tree ornaments they were from `Two Towers,' but are split-up, and take their characters in completely new directions. Aragorn, played with an unmatched sense of honor by Viggo Mortenson, is about to meet his destiny as the future king of all men, while Andy Serkis continues his expert portrayal of Gollum (Serkis' provided not only the voice of Gollum, but also assisted during production by acting out the scenes of the computer-generated character with his fellow actors).However, the real acting triumph of the film is Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins. He continues his descent into corruption with an incredible talent that many could not pull off. Wood's performance is so critical to the film because it determines the ring's power to corrupt, which, needless to say, is absolute.The first two films established Jackson as an incredible visionary, shooting vast landscapes from his native New Zealand. With `Return of the King,' Jackson really gets a chance to show off. With, hands down, the most beautiful visuals of the trilogy, Jackson makes `Return of the King' a gorgeous feast for the eyes, while never resorting to McG level over-the-topness. Jackson stays very grounded in his characters, not letting the effects tell the story, but only assist the wonderful dialogue and characters. Think of `Return' as a mix of `Fellowship' and `Two Towers,' with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event of this magnitude.The bottom line, fans of the films will not be disappointed. Hardcore Tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by Jackson and the other writers, however, it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels, being that film is an entirely different medium. Despite the alterations, Jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text, while adding some of the finest filmmaking ever put to screen. `The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made. Not only the best of the trilogy, but a crowning achievement in epic filmmaking.\",\n",

What could possibly go wrong?Obviously, the film is low budget and in this case, it shows.The direction is basic. The script divests you of feeling for the protagonists whose characterisation is quite two dimensional.. The plot is ridiculous and written with stupid characters making stupid decisions and written by people who have no idea about shark behaviour.Although I did say it was low budget there are some drone and cityscape establishing shots but I have no idea what relevance they have to the main part of the story.'I can't pee, if you are looking at me'.......they are all stranded in the water at sea. Laugh out loud funny. Very nearly 'Showgirls, so bad it's good' bad.\",\n",
       " \"My Review- No Hard Feelings\\nIn Cinemas now. My Rating. 1/10I'm not going to spend any time this review as the only positive thing I can say about it is that Andrew Barth Feldman who plays Percy Becker gives the best performance in a movie that I think is an insult to the craft of Cinema.The last movie I saw Jennifer Lawrence in was Causeway a 2022 movie that I thought warranted a respectable 7/10 rating.So I ask the question why would a 4 time Nominated Academy Award and Oscar winning actress like Jennifer Lawrence agree to appear in a movie that is supposed to be a comedy that I doubt would appeal to either a teen or adult movie audience?I'd ask the same question to Matthew Broderick and Laura Benanti who are both very talented stage and screen performers who play a pair of dumb rich colourless characters in this rubbish .They play a pair of overprotective parents who employ a 30 something dysfunctional woman Maddie played by Jennifer Lawrence to seduce their young teenage son Percy .Percy is a socially shy and sensitive boy who mostly stays in his room apart from his part time job at an animal shelter.His affluent over privileged parents Laird and Allison promise Maddie a new luxury car in the hope that once their son Percy is bedded by the curvy sexually savvy Maddie who's life is in total free fall that he will come out of himself and be ready to go to college at Princeton.If this movie was placed in a time capsule for future generations to see if by some miracle we survive for another century they would be certainly understand why America has fallen into the abyss it seems to be in today.Can you imagine if the gender roles in this offensive scenario were reversed and these same over privileged dumb parents employed a middle aged man to seduce their teenage daughter in a bid to make her worldly enough to enter college ?Perhaps I just don't get it and I'm to old to appreciate the scriptwriter appropriately named Gene Stupnitsky style but in my opinion it's a stupid and offensive movie that is an insult to anyone's intelligence .\",\n",
       " \"I have connected faster to characters in 40 minute tv show episodes than any of the characters in this 2 hour and 38 minute feature film. None of the characters are likeable, none of the characters have clear motivations - except Snow's friend, who constantly tells us that something is rotten in the state of Panem, in case the audience fail to connect the dots themselves.When the movie reached its conclusion, I had no idea what journey it was supposed to convey. If not for the pompous soundtrack (a dissapointing score by the otherwise great James Newton Howard - I think he struggled finding an emotional core in the screenplay) I wouldn't have known that the movie had reached the end, and our main characters journey towards evil was complete.And what the hell is it with all those music acts?! I know they are part of the book, but in the movie they are just annoying, mainly because the lead actress performing them sings like some cocky, pitch perfect dixie chick with overly theatrical facial expressions - resembling Jack Black at his most exaggerated.Katniss in the original movies felt grounded, real, vulnerable. Lucy in this one has no sense of purpose. She is just perfect, powerful and righteous from the get go, leaving no trace of dubiousness, no space for development, and thereby, no reason for the audience to connect with her. She feels like a plot device on Snow's journey towards darkness, with absolutely no chemisty between her and our antagonist to be.What a waste of my time.\",\n",
       " '\"Manjumel Boys,\" directed by Chidambaram, tells the compelling story of a group of friends embarking on a daring rescue mission to save their comrade from the treacherous Guna Caves. Released in February 2024, the film is based on a true story from Kodaikanal, adding a layer of authenticity to its narrative.Soubin Shahir delivers a commendable performance as Kuttan, portraying the role of a strong and loyal friend. However, Sreenath Bhasi\\'s role as Subhash is minimal, as he is mostly stuck in the cave unescapably. The film pays homage to the real-life heroes by staying true to their story and was recognized by the then Kerala chief minister, Mr. V. S Achuthanandan.Despite its intriguing premise, \"Manjumel Boys\" falls short in its pacing, with a slow first half lacking significant development and entertainment value, making it very boring. However, the film picks up momentum in the second half during the rescue operations, offering more excitement and engagement.The film\\'s portrayal of true friendship and bonds resonates well with the audience, particularly the youth. The visuals, especially those depicting Kodaikanal, are decent, and the background score adds to the overall experience. However, there are moments of lagging that hinder the film\\'s flow.A highlight of \"Manjumel Boys\" is its authentic portrayal of Malayali culture, enriching the narrative. The Vadamvali role also adds depth, pulling up Sreenath Bhasi\\'s performance along with Soubin Shahir\\'s. The climax, depicting the rescue from the cave, is beautifully executed, enhancing the emotional impact of the scene.While \"Manjumel Boys\" aims for a serious tone, staying true to real-life events, it falls short of being a standout movie. The media\\'s overrepresentation of its worth may lead to inflated expectations. It is recommended to watch this film at home rather than spending money on theater tickets, as it may not offer the expected cinematic experience. Overall, \"Manjumel Boys\" is an average movie with its moments but is better suited for a home viewing. I would rate it 5 out of 10, with no offense intended. This review is based on my viewing at York Cinemas, Richmond Hill, Ontario dated February 24, 2024.',\n",

The added touches are the children in this film, who are not only hilarious but also bring out the parental qualities in Drew and Sandler's characters. The holiday setting in this movie is also fantastic and adds a bit more quality to the film. The backing singers who appeared every now and then made me chuckle. The various activities that you find on a 5 star holiday are all here, which really makes you want to visit this resort.Overall it was really enjoyable to watch, I would highly recommend it\",\n",
       " \"As possibly the world's most influential film-maker, Spielberg has a responsibility. And that responsibility entails NOT using his cheesy, shallow sensibilities to turn one of the most profoundly horrible parts of human history into a soap opera-style piece of fluff. This film is more than just a bad film, it is a downright dangerously bad film that will be watched by millions of impressionable people who might have had few other sources to base their knowledge of the Holocaust on. Most of us agree that the worst thing to do about something like the Holocaust is to forget it, lest it happen again. The next worst thing is to trivialise it to the point where it resembles so many other Hollywood pieces of trash.What possesses a man who has become rich and powerful in the film industry solely through the making of shallow, transparent films for children to think that he is talented and wise enough to present to the masses a subject which should only be touched by the most careful and socially responsible hands? A Mid-life crisis, and an over-inflated ego, most likely, not that it matters though.Only someone with many years of study may be a doctor; only an experienced engineer may build a bridge, and even the guy who fixes your toilet must be a qualified plumber. Yet this fool, whose only previous qualifications have been cheap, shallow, movies made strictly for entertainment, thinks he is in a rightful position to educate our children. Because, unfortunately, many people have a frighteningly limited amount of knowledge about the second world war, and Schindler's List will be for many of them their main source of information. Showing it to them in as cheesy and hollow a fashion as almost only Spielberg can, is simply a crime.\",\n",

None of the Aging gimmick makes sense and just ends up delivering unintentionally funny moments. There's no good reason to care about any character here. It's all done so poorly.The camerawork is terrible in places where the shots are out of focus and many faces and objects are poorly positioned, plus M. Night kept doing long spinning camera shots over and over again. Why? No idea felt pretentious to me. Simply awful, and there was me hoping M.

       " \"Here, the makers took the original stock horror film and turned it into an Indianajonesesque adventure in the tradition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The most visually rich part of the film was the opening scenes set in ancient Egypt. I would love to see an entire film built around that. The sets and costumes were brilliant.Especially tantalizing is the strictly painted-on attire of Patricia Velazquez as Anck-Su-Namum; what a stunning visual; but it completely upstages her performance. I have heard people talking about it. Some have mistakenly guessed her top was a mesh costume of some sort; not true, it is entirely - and only - paint.But Velazquez isn't the only thing to turn heads in the film, Rachel Weisz is appropriately attractive, though not as startling; her character is as solid and believable as she is lovely.The newcomer, Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bey, set quite a few female hearts aflutter; in our party, at least. The internet was lit-up searching for more photos of this guy.At first, I didn't particularly care for Brendan Fraser as the primary character (he's too well kept and cutesy for a rugged guy-type for me), be he grows on you. He seems to be developing into a versatile actor who will be around for a long time. His work here is good too.The special effects were the real star of the film, and they were visually rewarding and complimented the story in the right way in the right places. How Arnold Vosloo dealt with those in his role as the mummy Imhotep should be acknowledged. He must have had to imagine quite a bit of what he was interacting with to pull it off, and he does so with great style and substance for this type of role. He was nothing short of excellent.In fact, most of the remaining characters were well chosen. Jonathan Hyde and Kevin J. O'Connor added to the film in important ways, too. Together, everyone painted an enjoyable film, delivering exactly what it promised; fun, action, and adventure.\",\n",
       " \"The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre.  There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.)  There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects.  With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync.  Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition.  Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes.  The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky.  The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of.  The photography was breathtaking.  (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.)  And the acting?  Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did.  But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting.  As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked!  Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne.  His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation.  My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE.  What is the Matrix, you ask?  Something that's closer to reality than you think.Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time.\",\n",
       " \"When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now. I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie.

There is a fine line though between quirky kinda funny and NOT funny at all. Quirky means odd, yet fascinating and a subtle (tongue in cheek) kinda funny, but this movie never reached that fine subtle level of comedy. Worse, I didnt even laugh once, not even a smirk or a smile. I did frown a lot...and sighed a lot...that's not what I longed for ofcourse...They really tried to make this turn into a subtle quirky comedy, BUT its' OFF, it's just not working, it's too predictable and because of that quite boring to watch actually. And the many terrific supporting actors (way better than Chris Pine will ever be) those great, older actors only made this movie more painful to watch, because they have all starred in WAY better and WAY more popular and WAY more original (classic) movies than this unforunate flop.\",\n",

       " \"I happen to be one of the folks who really has enjoyed these films in the prequel trilogy.  I also can see why people would not like the films and I don't deny people the right to their opinion.  What has been bothering me has been some of the reasons people are giving for hating these new films... they are childish, they have too many special-effects, the acting is bad, the writing is bad, Lucas has sold out and has lost his touch... it makes me wonder if people are actually remembering the original trilogy correctly. Don't get me wrong, I love the original trilogy, but they weren't exactly well-acted or well-written movies.  We didn't love them because they were these great Shakespearian works of art; we loved them because we were little kids totally enraptured by this exciting fantastical world.  It seems that those same kids that loved the films 20 years ago have grown up into stuffy old yuppies that have no idea how to have fun anymore.  Our generation has grown up and it seems that we wanted Star Wars to grow up with us, to morph into some new R-rated grown up version to satisfy our more mature needs. Well, we didn't like the original trilogy because it was all grown up and serious.  We liked it because it was silly and fun and awesome to look at. I am personally glad that George Lucas did not make the prequels into a new grown up version.  I like the adventure and excitement and I challenge the one major complaint that says that they do not live up to the originals. Let's look at what people have complained about when comparing these to the original trilogy.-The new movies are too childish and geared towards kids: So, somehow we're supposed to believe that the droids, aliens, spaceships swamp monsters, and warriors with mystical powers from the original trilogy were of the more mature variety.-The new movies have too many special effects: We're forgetting that the original movies were also special effects laden.  Lucas has always pushed the limits of technology, even inventing new technology all the way.  He has not sold out or changed or just now relied on special effects, he has always concentrated on the effects.  If he had digital technology 20 years ago, he would have done the same thing then that he has now.  That's what he does; he makes up worlds that don't exist and then comes up with a way to put them on film.-The writing has been bad on the new films: Does anybody recall Lucas ever receiving a Pulitzer Prize?-The acting has been bad on the new films: Carrie Fisher???  Mark Hamill??? Harrison Ford???  We're not exactly talking about Academy Award winners here.  Name me one of the original main actors who was actually a great actor (other than Sir Alec).  Now, Harrison Ford has had a great career, but he's no Jack Nicholson.  And where are Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill now?-Anakin is just a whiny little brat: Does anybody also remember how whiny Luke was in the first two movies?  I mean, he did nothing but whine and complain until Jedi.  And how many times did they say that Luke was just like his father?  Should anybody then be surprised that Anakin was a whiny adolescent?I think my point here is that people from my generation have taken something they loved as a kid and put it up on a pedestal so high that they are confused as to why they liked it.  They think the original movies were these serious Academy Award caliber pieces of art and that's why they liked them. In fact, we liked them because they were cool and had monsters and space battles and there were toys that we could play with and have fun.  The new movies are of the same mold as the original, they are unchanged.  WE have changed and we're having a hard time dealing with that fact.  Some would argue that these movies are not true Star Wars movies.  I say, they are exactly the same... that's why I love them.  If I want a serious film, I'll go find somethings starring Daniel Day-Lewis.  I like action and science fiction, so I'll stick to the childish, poorly acted stuff.\",\n",

       " 'Hitman is definitely a film-lover\\'s paradise but even the casual film viewer will thoroughly enjoy this brilliant new movie. Linklater\\'s latest lovingly pays homage to film noir, screwball comedy, Hitchcockian black comedy and even the good old psychosexual drama but it still somehow manages to conjure up a fresh, witty and often uproarious confection that frequently teases, delights and occasionally thrills the audience with frissons of excitement, keeping them enraptured all the way to its deliciously razor sharp ending.This is potentially a star-making turn for Glen Powell. Although he made a strong impression in Top Gun: Maverick as a cocky rival pilot, his role in Hit Man is easily more complex and, as the co-writer of the script, he has been able to add brilliant layers to his character, or should that be characters? In effect, Powell is playing more than one character - Gary Johnson, mild-mannered, cat-loving geeky Psychology professor and audio techie who moonlights as a surveillance expert for a Louisana-based police unit that targets and stings hapless ne\\'er-do-wells who are looking to hire a killer. Before the next sting operation, Gary\\'s police colleague Jasper (Austin Amelio) who normally pretends to be the hired killer is suspended for brutally attacking two youths, which forces Gary\\'s colleagues (brilliantly played by Retta and Sanjay Rao) into convincing Gary to take over from the universally loathed Jasper, much to Gary\\'s dismay. Yet, within minutes of taking on the task, Gary suddenly morphs into \"Ron\" and during his first sting he is so convincing that his colleagues are shocked, even though they had believed he could do it having heard Jasper go through the rigamarole on previous occasions. It is a brilliant piece of acting.Having created the killer persona, Gary soon finds himself becoming more and more immersed in Ron, adding further, chameleon-like layers of disguise and character traits to mirror whoever is about to be stung. However, things become really complicated (in true film noir style) when \"Ron\" is approached by a femme fatale, Maddy (beautifully played by Adria Ajrona who also adds a delightfully a kooky sexy edge as well as a tender vulnerability). As the sparks between the two begin to fly during a hilarious but flirty exchange, Gary, who is clearly enjoying himself as Ron, finds himself conflicted. Dare he. As Ron, continue with the sting and have Maddy arrested for plotting to murder her husband? Has the flirtatious exchange caused Maddy to betray some regrets about what she is doing? The chemistry between Powell and Arjona is a pleasure to witness. Both actors bring out the best in one another and it is thrilling.Off-beat is an expression that would certainly apply to Hit Man - and it is a compliment. It is also one of the most enjoyable and fun 2 hours I\\'ve had in the cinema in the past few years. I absolutely adore this film.',\n",

       " 'Martin Scorsese has done it again. His newest and most refreshing effort he\\'s contributed to the world of cinema in years, The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring thrill ride that is both absolutely hilarious and meticulously constructed. It also presents Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio in possibly his finest acting performance of his career. At one-minute shy of three hours, I was both engaged and hypnotized nearly the entire duration. A comedic epic that studies the behavior and cultures of a time in America, feels like the uncovering of a time capsule that was buried and dug up to give insight into our current financial crisis. Much more than just laughs, it turns on the dramatic elements early enough in the film to warrant considerable reactions about the choices of our key characters. Expertly paced with intelligent moral questions presented, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of the year.Telling the story of Jordan Belfort, a young Wall Street broker that gets involved in drugs, money, and even more drugs during the 80\\'s and 90\\'s. In his tenure trading (and stealing), Jordan marries, divorces, does drugs, marries again, does even more drugs, makes solid friendships, and believe it or not, does a lot more drugs. Watching the destruction of Jordan acted as a documentarian\\'s insight that felt like I was watching \"Intervention\" without the family that cares. The Wolf of Wall Street is a black comedy, giving hints of drama. Natural comparisons will fly to Oliver Stone\\'s Wall Street which is accurate but you can see subtle hints of films like Trading Places, Glengarry Glen Ross, and even American Psycho. That\\'s a testament to Scorsese\\'s outstanding direction and Terence Winter\\'s masterful screenplay. Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size, sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons, but functioning morons. They\\'re like the frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus, being loud and obnoxious, and made terrible life choices that they still aren\\'t aware of until this day. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast to inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernathal, and Kyle Chandler. All of which seem to be having the time of their lives.A lot of the credit of the film\\'s overall success has to be awarded to Leonardo DiCaprio. I\\'ve never seen him truly \"go for it\" in a way that he exhibits as Jordan Belfort. In his breaking of the fourth wall, to his long but completely engaging monologues about life, money, and greed, it\\'s the most assured and compelling work by the actor to date. When DiCaprio unleashed his talents in the mid-90\\'s in What\\'s Eating Gilbert Grape? and later stole the hearts of tween girls everywhere in Titanic, who knew this is the role he\\'d been gearing up to play. This is the role of his career and something that the Academy Awards should look to for his long overdue recognition. It\\'s a charming and adventurous turn that presents a conundrum to the audience as we find ourselves both enamored and loathing the pure essence of Jordan. A sequence of DiCaprio crawling on the floor will probably be the scene of the year. This is DiCaprio\\'s crowning achievement.As the magnetic and cheesy-minded right-hand man, Jonah Hill\\'s performance as Donnie Azoff is another great turn for the 30-year-old actor. He\\'s allowed to explore some of his comedic ticks and beats that he may not have ever had the opportunity to explore in films like Superbad or 21 Jump Street. In Wolf, he relies on his own instincts, and his chemistry with DiCaprio, which has helped him before for his Oscar-nominated work in Moneyball opposite Brad Pitt. Matthew McConaughey, is one scene shy of winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. While his work in Dallas Buyers Club will bring him the acclaim and recognition that he deserves, The Wolf of Wall Street is a prime example of what he should be doing when he\\'s not working or seeking out the strong, independent features that are geared for awards recognition. Stealing every frame and focus from DiCaprio in his ten minute screen time, McConaughey utilizes all his charm and spunk as Mark Hanna, the mentor to young Jordan as he started out.Like any great Scorsese film, the women are in full-force and given the opportunity to shine like the others. Cristin Millotti, a toned down and tragic version of Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny, is sensational in her brief appearances on screen. Beautiful and sympathetic, she offers much needed serious and dramatic elements to Jordan\\'s outrageous antics. In the end, a star is born in the gorgeous and vivacious Margot Robbie as Naomi Lapaglia, Jordan\\'s second wife. Whoever was going to be cast as Naomi, had to be an actress of considerable talent and had the ability to really be the sexy kitten but still warrant an emotional reaction from the audience when called upon. Margot Robbie was the perfect choice and she\\'ll need to owe Scorsese royalties for years to come with the roles she\\'ll be offered following this. Robbie is pure magic and is everything she\\'s required to be. She\\'s the more elusive, compelling, and more thought out version of Scarlett Johansson\\'s character in Don Jon.I loved every second of The Wolf of Wall Street. Terence Winter\\'s script is a natural and well-oiled machine that produces the words of a demigod. You couldn\\'t make these things up. Thelma Schoonmaker is the utmost professional and continues to shine film after film. You won\\'t find another dedicated and glossed editing work this year. The other supporting actors do sensational work especially Kyle Chandler, who has a very well-constructed exchange on a boat with DiCaprio, has us asking more and more, why is this guy not helming his own films on a consistent basis yet?',\n",
       " 'This movie never fails to generate strong reactions, both positive and negative.Much of the negative criticizes the wooden acting, soap-opera beautiful stars, and unreasonably military tactics that lead to an enormous human body count.  But that misses the whole point.  The actors and plotlines are supposed to be caricatures of themselves.  We are presented with a seemingly utopian society, where everyone is beautiful, the world is united under a single government, and patriotism is rampant.The further the movie goes, the more the viewer realizes just how horrific this supposed utopia really is.  Patriotism is exploited to trick young men and women into going off to a pointless war.  The beautiful people are mercilessly chopped to pieces by their insectoid opponents.  And the united world government uses its control of the media to brainwash the public into supporting this bloody war.Yes, the Nazi symbolism is a little heavy-handed.  But that\\'s the whole point -- the intertwining of this \"perfect\" society with such a deeply evil subtext is supposed to be disturbing.  What\\'s even more disturbing is how close to our recent (American) history this movie truly is.  Yes, it\\'s a caricature, but it\\'s a caricature of a very real and frightening phenomenon.How different are the government propaganda ads in Starship Troopers from the \"Loose Lips Sink Ships\" campaign or the \"10% for War Bonds\" posters in 1940s U.S.?  How dangerous is it to have a society where everyone looks the same, thinks the same, and acts the same, even to their own death?  This is the message behind Starship Troopers, and it\\'s a chilling one at that.And for me, it works.',\n",
       " 'Greetings again from the darkness. It\\'s easy to forget that Russell Crowe was once Oscar nominated three years in a row, winning Best Actor for Ridley Scott\\'s epic, GLADIATOR (2000), and has probably deserved two or three additional nominations. His reputation has not won him many industry friends over the years, but to his credit, he keeps plugging away - some minor roles in big films, and some lead roles in smaller films. Crowe can still command the screen with his presence, even when the material is slight (see THE POPE\\'S EXORCIST, 2023).This project from writer-director Adam Cooper (writer, EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS, 2014) and his frequent writing partner Bill Collage has been adapted from Eugen O. Chirovici\\'s 2017 novel, \"The Book of Mirrors\". It\\'s Cooper\\'s directorial debut, and it\\'s entertaining enough, especially if one can avoid comparisons to other similar crime drama films, especially the classic MEMENTO (2000). In this one, Crowe stars as Roy Freeman, a former homicide detective who lost his badge after a drunk driving accident. He has recently undergone an experimental brain procedure designed to help him regain some of the memories Alzheimer\\'s has robbed him of. Roy\\'s apartment has notes posted everywhere. These notes remind him of his name, remind him of his shoe size, and remind him that his Hungry Man dinners are hot when they come out of the microwave. Turns out, it\\'s too late for a note to remind him not to put the TV remote in that same mircrowave.A ten year old case he worked is brought up by a group looking to prevent an innocent man from being executed. Roy has no memory of the case, so he re-visits the files and tracks down his old partner, Jimmy Remis (played by Tommy Flanagan, in a reunion of GLADIATOR actors). What follows is a sufficiently intricate web of characters to keep us interested and guessing. The murder victim was Professor Wieder (Marton Csokas), and the usual suspects include his PTSD-suffering handyman Wayne Devereaux (Thomas M Wright), Wieder\\'s research assistant and lover Laura Baines (Karen Gillan, Nebula in the Marvel Universe), Laura\\'s other lover Richard Finn (Harry Greenwood) who is writing a book on the murder, and a couple other characters tossed in to knock Roy and us off track.Flanagan and Csokas are two of my favorite character actors - both always bring something interesting to their roles, and here it\\'s Gillan\\'s Laura that seems to offer the most intrigue - changing names, locales, and personalities, all while publishing a book on a theory of how \\'bad\\' memories can be replaced with good ones, or erased altogether (think of another classic film, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, 2004). Roy\\'s flashbacks are handled by quick spurts of moments that he struggles to assemble, which allows us to struggle right alongside him. Roy\\'s plight leaves us with the thought that it\\'s possible to find yourself, and not like what you see. Memory is obviously crucial to the story, and for a second-level crime thriller, there is enough here to keep us going until the conclusion.In theaters beginning March 22, 2024.',\n",
       " \"People were hyping this movie up like it was the second coming of Brian. But not only did it fail to evoke any response mildly resembling a laugh, it in fact made me wonder what people even consider to be funny these days.It's over-the-top satire, sure, I get that, and I even get what this movie tries to poke fun at, but I just found myself being unable to enjoy or even connect with this particular style of annoying teenage humour. I don't know if this is a generational thing or a cultural thing... it could be both. All I know is that it just wasn't for me.I don't think I'll ever recommend this to anyone, but neither would I recommend against it. Because humour is extremely subjective, and maybe this might be the funniest movie you'd have seen.\",\n",

       " \"I finally got to see this movie in the bargain theaters here in El Paso on Labor Day. I originally hadn't thought much about the movie, but as time went on it had left the regular theaters here in town and I realized that I'd wished I'd gone to see it. I remember hearing several outside critics blasting the movie as horrible and wanted to judge for myself. I'm very glad I finally saw this movie.This movie is not the usual Clash of the Titans/Jason and the Argonauts type of movie where the gods are constantly shown and portrayed as more important and powerful than the lowly humans. In fact, this movie completely ignores the so-called gods and instead places the focus where it belongs -- on the warriors themselves. I have studied the Iliad as well as other stories surrounding the mythical Trojan War since my days as an elementary school geek obsessed with mythology and Dungeons & Dragons. Instead of being targeted toward that audience this film demystifies the Trojan War and treats it in a manner in which it could have actually happened. We see that the elders who continually refer to their so-called gods come across as fools. One of the most telling lines is when Hector (Eric Bana) refers to the fact that Apollo did not strike down Achilles (Brad Pitt) for desecrating the statue. It is very telling that Hector seems to doubt the gods he has been taught to worship.I have been a longtime critic of Brad Pitt as a second-tier talent who became famous only because of his looks, but in this film he surprised me. He is the TRUE star of the film. Achilles is easily the most interesting and entertaining character. I applaud Brad Pitt's effort in making his character a tragic hero. Achilles acknowledges that he is NOT the son of a goddess and is not immortal or invulnerable. The movie basically shows us how a rumor can blossom into a legend unto itself. Achilles' legend BECOMES immortal. He even refers to this in my favorite scene when he is inspiring his men and starts the invasion heavily outnumbered and still triumphs. Later in the same scene he scoffs at the so-called gods the Greeks and Trojans worship by decapitating the statue. I found this scene symbolic of the movie itself. The gods are nothing to both the characters and audience.Instead of supernatural powers and impossible feats we're treated to realism. Even Achilles' death is more realistic than in the myth. In the myth Paris does kill Achilles with an arrow, but because he has no battle skills his hand is actually guided by Apollo.If there was one thing I did not like in this film it was the transformation of Paris into some kind of hero. Paris was a coward in the original myth and I saw no reason to transform him into an overnight hero in the movie. I guess Orlando Bloom fans wouldn't be able to bear seeing him as the bad guy and were given the uninspired transformation of Paris into a better archer than Robin Hood.While this movie was nowhere near the epic masterpiece that the producers had hoped or that it was advertised as, it did not deserve the bad publicity it received from critics. I applaud the makers of this film and look forward to buying it on DVD.\",\n",

       " 'Blade Runner (1982) was a happy (yet gloomy) accident, involving: a) a young and ambitious director who fought ferociously with studio executives in order for them to let him fulfill his vision; b) a rising blockbuster star who wanted to prove he can also act in a serious movie; c) a crazy Dutch actor who decided to change the script and improvise one of the most memorable monologues in film history; d) a bunch of talented artists who wanted to make a movie that would look and sound different from anything else we had seen before. And most of all, e) a post-Vietnam turbulent era when Hollywood rebels like Coppola, Scorsese and Cimino were audaciously attempting to reinvent the language of cinema, telling stories that mattered and not caring at all about target audiences and marketing trends. As a result, Blade Runner was a box office failure that slowly became a legend, breaking stereotypes like \"good guy kills bad guy at the end\" and dealing with existential agony on an almost metaphysical level; always within the context of a gritty corporate dystopia in the near future.Blade Runner 2049 is none of these things. On the contrary, it\\'s the flawed triumph of a next generation of studio executives, who control the creative process by paying millions to the industry\\'s best of the best, providing they will make something that will take advantage of a successful brand name in order to bring profits to shareholders. If there is one word to describe this movie, it\\'s \"replicant\". Not the kind of replicant who realizes that \"all those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain\" as he dies, but a sleek, expensive and obedient skin-job that will try to entertain you and if it succeeds will return as a sequel that will eventually become yet another franchise. I spent 160 minutes of my life watching a pleasant and perfectly constructed piece of nothing, and I didn\\'t care for a moment about any of the characters or a storyline that was designed without the intention to question and redefine a single thing. All its moments have already been lost in my memory, while the original Blade Runner remains vivid in my mind, as if I only saw it yesterday.',\n",
       " \"Talk to Me is a stone cold classic of the horror genre. It feels fresh, thrilling, absorbing, and has a brilliant concept at its core.The story follows a group of friends who play around with the occult, contacting the spirit world through a mysterious ceramic hand. As you might expect, things go off the rails quickly and insidious activity ensues.The way the story is set up is superb, giving a fresh spin on a somewhat tired horror trope and bringing it into the 21st century with style.It contains a strong collection of characters with great performances behind them all and solid writing that doesn't feel cliche or tired.Stylistically I think the film is superb, with the direction on point. There are some neat creative flourishes and a brilliant use of sound, both of which really contribute to the overall atmosphere, which is one of constant suspense and unease.I don't think the film is particularly scary, relying more on body horror and disturbing imagery, but it is very unnerving and tense nonetheless.The only reason I'm not scoring this higher is that I think some of the concepts could have been taken a little further, and some of the horror dialled up a notch, but these are minor criticisms really.Talk to Me is one of the most refreshing and engaging horror films I've seen in a while, and will be sure to be a treat for any horror fans out there.\",\n",
       " \"To begin with, I have to say that I saw the movie first, and read the book years later. This seems to be important: Nearly everybody who read the book first hates the movie, but most of those who saw the movie first seem to like it.Now, why is this so? I cannot really understand it because, in comparition to other movies based on existing literature, what we have here is a film which stays very close to the original story and does not add many new elements.When I read the book, I could see the movie in front of me in nearly every chapter. So I really don't understand what Herbert-Fans had expected from this movie...I for my part like it a lot. It has a very mystical atmosphere about it and the story develops nicely. Of course there are some elements which are simply not explained and are therefore very confusing, but somehow this seems to be a thing Lynch tends to do in every of his movies, so what? I like some simple scenes like the opening monologue a whole lot. I LOVE the music (which played in my mind all the time while I read the book), and I think the characters are very strong and (for example Letho Atreides) sometimes full of tragedy.The part I like the most though is the worm-part. I think the special effects are not always brilliant, but seeing the scenes with the worms, I am really awestruck because they are so impressing.All in all, I think this is one of the more underrated movies in Science Fiction history. It may be because the director himself was not happy with it, or because fans expected too much from a simple two hour movie. I always enjoy watching this film and listening to the soundtrack. And I would love to see a Director's Cut version.\",\n",
       " 'What brilliant trash this film is! It works absolutely every time! For all I know it was filmed either at Uncle Ron\\'s or El Matador here in town!Road House is the story of a bouncer hired to clean up a rough bar in a tiny town. He isn\\'t just your ordinary illiterate muscle head, though. It\\'s Patrick Swayze. He\\'s got a degree in philosophy from NYU! He owns a Mercedes! Why, he\\'s the best damn cooler in the business! And it\\'s a good thing he is. This fictional town of Jasper, MO is dominated by a slimy Boss-Hogg type played by Ben Gazzara. He and his thugs skim money from every business in town, and the last thing they want is some stranger waltzing on to the scene to break up their control of the action. Enough plot, though. Let\\'s focus on the highlights.This film has a script that should be bronzed or put on display at the Smithsonian. We get monumental lines such as:\"It\\'s good to see you!\" spoken by a blind man when he first greets Swayze.\"What do you take me for?\" a bimbo asks another bar patron in an early scene. the reply- \"About a hundred dollars!\"And this film also contains the greatest line ever spoken in the history of cinema. Decorum prohibits me from stating it verbatim, but you\\'ll probably know it when you hear it. It\\'s spoken by pro wrestler Terry Funk who plays the bouncer Swayze replaces. The line focuses on the supposed size of Swayze\\'s package, and the size vehicle his seed could fill.The film is filled with bar fights that eventually turn into shootouts, hot women, fast cars, monster trucks, explosions, you name it. Anything for guys who like movies is in abundance. The whole thing plays out like a typical night on the town for us yokels here in the red states.The film comes in surprisingly long at 114 minutes, but don\\'t worry. This is the type of film you can basically stop at any place, then push play when you and your friends get back from the bars. \"It will be like you never left,\" as Christopher Lloyd tells Michael J. Fox at one point in Back to the Future. The film has more than its share of logical lapses. As Roger Ebert points out in his review, there is no way anyone could get as rich as Wesley by skimming this little town. It seems to only have a bar, an auto parts store, a Ford dealership, and a cafe or two. Most of these places get wiped out as the action unfolds. It makes you wonder who would have been left for Wesley to skim from. But criticism of a film like this is useless. When faced with such an artistic statement as Road House, one can either sit back and enjoy, or chuck the tape out the window. 10 of 10 stars.The genius of Joel Silver my know no boundaries.Added 9-14-2009: We\\'ll see you on the other side, Patrick!

       " \"I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future.Many people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I've grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there's a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it's ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.As it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/\",\n",
       " 'Let me start by saying that I\\'m a huge fan of the \"The Hunger Games\" book series by Suzanne Collins. I\\'ve read them countless times and when I found out they were making a movie of them a little over a year ago I was very excited. But I was also worried.\"The Hunger Games\" is not very easy source material. The book is written in first person narrative with very detailed descriptions of everything form the characters\\' looks to the strange futuristic devices they use in Panem, the future version of the U.S. where the story takes place. I couldn\\'t imagine that they would be able to convey every detail as I had imagined it and make the story believable without an R-rating or a huge budget. All of my concerns were wiped away when I saw the movie.I\\'ve never seen a more faithful adaption of a book in my life. All of the costumes, the sets, the locations, the cast (I\\'ll talk more about them in a while) and the pacing is as if they were exactly replicated from the book. And the small things that do differ or are added (such as more insight to the gamemakers\\' control room) only add to the amazing world Collins created and improve the narrative movie-wise. And the movie is great for people who haven\\'t read the books as well. Not once did I feel as if something was vague or badly explained.The cast is stellar. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss carries the movie and makes me regret complaining about her casting because she was too \"hot\" and not starved enough. She IS Katniss and one can feel the graveness of an situation just by looking at one of her expressions. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta is also a true breakout performance. The way he looks at Katniss will makes girls all over the world envy her, just like it\\'s supposed to be. Other standouts in the cast include Stanley Tucci as the flamboyant talk-show host Caesar Flickerman, Woody Harrelson as the sarcastic but caring mentor Haymitch and Wes Bentley as the sinister game-maker Seneca Crane (his final scene might be the best one in the whole movie). The child actors Willow Shields and Amandla Stendberg who portrays Prim and Rue are believable and heartbreaking even though they\\'re inexperienced.Despite the PG-13 rating the movie doesn\\'t gloss over or sugarcoat anything for their audience. The violence may not be gloriously graphic but it\\'s still there. People will feel the tributes\\' pain and despair and not even realize the violence isn\\'t gory until you\\'ve left the theater. The movie also deals with important themes like survival, governmental control, grief and helplessness. There is a minor love story subplot, but it doesn\\'t distract from the movies main themes. In my opinion I think it rather improves them by showing some light in the dark.The only complaint I can think of is that the movie feels too short. It\\'s almost two and a half hours long, but it feels as if it goes by in a blink. I will have to see it again to fully pay attention to every detail (such as the costumes and animation of the Capitol, which looked amazing). But this is still not me saying that the movie is rushed, because as I stated the source material is very dense and the filmmakers managed include almost everything.People are expecting this to become the next Twilight-style teen movie franchise. I can\\'t say I think the two stories have anything in common even though I hope \"The Hunger Games\" will do as well at the box office. But if the first movie is any indication of the quality of what\\'s to come - this will be a series way out of Twilight\\'s league.',\n",
       " \"The first eighty percent of this film was excellent - it felt like the best Stephen King story that King didn't write. The slow destruction of the life of an ordinary man for reasons which were completely outside his control was well-conceived, well-plotted and well acted. Nicholas Cage's performance was pitch perfect.To an extent, this film can be seen as a satirical condemnation of social media fame and cancel culture, though that's secondary to the theme of mounting paranoia - both from Prof Matthews and the wider world.The fact that this film started out as a project of Ari Aster is no surprise, as it has much in common with Beau is Afraid - notably the hapless and powerless central character and some surreal and blackly comic moments.Then, in the last fifteen minutes or so, the film loses its way. A new element is brought in which pretty much undermines what had gone before. The result wasn't bad, exactly, but seemed to belong in a different film. I think it would've been better if the film had had the courage of its convictions and followed Prof Matthews to his logical fate.For all that, it's an interesting film, and I would urge you to see it.\",\n",

In that sense, but in the best way imaginable, \\'Alien\\' is the atomic bomb.In my opinion, \\'Alien\\' is the only perfect movie in the history of cinema. Of course, this could be debatable, but of all the films I\\'ve watched since I was born, this is the only one in which I haven\\'t been able to find the slightest flaw. It gets a golden ten out of ten. Bright, solid and massive.I could go on with a panegyric, but I\\'ll try to be short and accurate:The direction is just perfect. Every shot is marvellous, every movement of the camera is breathtaking. There is absolutely nothing you could add or subtract. Touch it, and you spoil it. Seriously.The acting is splendid.

Not only the look, but the complete design of a life form, including biological features. Acid instead of blood. Jaws inside jaws. What more could you possibly want? This is how a movie is done.A very good sign of a movie that has gone down in history is the amount of collectively well remembered scenes. Well, \\'Alien\\' has so many that I won\\'t go into it.

I urge all young directors to watch this movie a zillion times, as I\\'ve already done, and take notes all along.

The movie lets Steve Carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both Jim Carrey in \"Bruce Almighty\" and Will Ferrell \"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy\" in their movies. Paul Rudd is hilarious as always. I love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas (like P.S.).

The way the movie started in Europe and how dark it was there... and the journey to Jerusalem... just wonderful stuff up to that point.Liam Neeson, as usual, is just SO GOOD, you wish he had more screen time.Orlando Bloom, actually surprisingly, was able to carry the movie as a lead. I was surprised he had the heft to do it, but I agree with the critic who said that the beard helped. He was a man, not a boy.Battle scenes... incredible. I was really surprised that they could wow me, since we\\'ve been numbed by the quality of battle scenes in so many previous movies, but they did a great job.Portrayal of the Muslims. EXTREMELY fair. In being \"even-handed\" to Christians and Muslims there, if anything, they emphasized the Christian fanatics (in the form of the Templars in particular, to simplify things) as being the \"badguys\" more than anyone else... (which is historically accurate to some degree, in my understanding). I was surprised and pleased that they tried to be accurate, and didn\\'t try to emphasize some \"BAD MUSLIMS\" to make it \"even\".Movie is very secular in it\\'s moralizing.And it portrays Christianity particularly religious men, VERY badly (the Priest who steals the cross from Bloom\\'s wife\\'s corpse... the Bishop in Jerusalem who\\'s ready to convert to Islam at the first sign of defeat... and who also wants to abandon the civilians... the knights templar...) I thought this got a tad gratuitous. There were really NO GOOD Christian FIGURES IN THE MOVIE. The only good purported Christians were basically acting Agnostic (Bloom, Neeson, etc.) The actual religious Christians were made out to be hypocrites.Meanwhile Saladhudin was a man of honor.. but also somewhat moderate.Movie could definitely have a little more narrative focus and maybe have a little more of an emotional circle for Orlando Bloom character. The emotional arc is ALREADY complete fairly early in the movie (Bloom becomes a man of conscience)... and it\\'s kind of boring since the character doesn\\'t really move after that.But the movie tackled a HUGE topic and tackled it fairly well. I just wish there was a better script to handle the compelling personal journey for Orlando Bloom (from widower, murderer seeking redemption, lost bastard son) that was PROMISED at the beginning.It seems that as soon as he brings water to his father\\'s old land, he\\'s just about done his journey, and it turns into a simple historical battle movie.

My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about. I will say that I cannot recall *ever* having been \"asked\" by a film to both suspend my disbelief the way this film asks in its third act AND at the same time come to terms with an understanding that there is no room--or need--for disbelief.Perhaps these comments will not make sense to the average movie goer who will dismiss this film--and, unfortunately, its premise--as another hollywood flick filled with gratuitous violence. I\\'d go as far as to say that this film is not about violence. It is about choices. It is about activity. It is about lethargy. It is about waking up and realizing that at some point in the past we\\'ve gone to the toilet and thrown up our dreams without even realizing that society has stuck its fingers down our throat.I would argue that anyone caught, at some point in their lives, between a rock and a hard place--anyone who has reached bottom on a mental level--anyone who has uttered to themselves \"Wait, this isn\\'t right. I would not do/say/feel what it is that I just did/said/felt... I do not like this. I must change before I am forever stuck being the person that I am not.\" These people, they will know what I\\'m talking about. These people will not only recognize the similarities between Edward Norton\\'s character and themselves--they will be uncomfortably familiar with him. These people will appreciate Fight Club for what it is: a wake up call that we are not alone.As David Berman once said: \"I\\'m afraid I\\'ve got more in common with who I was than who I am becoming.\" If this sentence makes any sense to you, go see Fight Club. You won\\'t regret it.L.',\n",

       " \"The Green Mile is a masterwork. This is film as art, at it's very best. The depth of the cast is extraordinary, with all of the players delivering excellent performances. There is a clear sense here that all involved in the production knew that this was something special, and gave it their all. See this film if you truly enjoy actors giving everything to their craft. Watch for the countless subtleties of expression, and the great power that the cast creates with silence. This is evident in the opening sequence and remains throughout. Above all, Michael Duncan as John Coffey is exceptional. He brings gripping emotion to a unique, fascinating character.The Green Mile should bring you joy, laughter, and if you are like most in the theater this night, tears.BRAVO!\",\n",
       " 'The only thing i can say is that when i left the movie theater then i had no comment to give... This movie got to me deep! I was 14 and now i am 25,and still i remember it so well and i still watch it sometimes.. Brandon Lee did a great job as an actor like everyone else, but the story about his death is totally insane, which made me worship the movie even more. What an irony. I like the movie cause it\\'s dark, but also lighted up with true emotions..there is action, horror, love, even poetry for god sake! I have never seen so many genre\\'s in one movie. Anyway for me it has been one of the best movies i have ever watched. And one more comment, lots of of other movies got ideas from The Crow, meaning the setting, the action, music, whatever it is the crow was their start up. I am not going to name them, Crow fans probably know what i am talking about.. My favorite quote: \"Can\\'t rain all the time\" By the way the soundtrack\\'s are awesome, The Cure\\'s best song ever made is in it! P.S. The Crow II and III sucked, i hated it. They just ruined the conception of the first one.. totally..',\n",
       " \"Quick review: 'Eileen' is one of those films where all the pieces were there to be something great, but they just weren't quite assembled correctly. The film just comes across a little flat. There's quite a prolonged and drawn out build-up, and then the pay-off isn't quite worthy of it. I still liked the film, don't get me wrong, but I can't help feeling it could've been something more.There are a few attempts at humour long the way, none of them really land though. And there are a couple of fake-out scenes that were truly shocking, but ultimately meant nothing unfortunately. Not a bad film, but not one I'm sure I'll remember much of a year from now. 6.5/10.\",\n",
       " \"The original 2004 comedy Mean Girls, directed by Mark Waters and starring Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams, is one of my favorite movies of all time. I've seen it too many times to count in many different fashions, so needless to say I was extremely nervous to view this version, because what if it was ruined? And need I say, it was pretty awful. I mean come on, a cringey modernized musical version that nobody asked for? Why?This version took everything that was original and fresh about the original and puts it to shame, instead of being funny it was focused on cramming every social media platform ever, TikTok? Check, Instagram? Check, etc. And frankly it was not fun seeing these iconic characters burst into song at the most random moments ever, 2 songs from the Broadway version weren't even in the thing 💀.Renee Rapp hard carried, but if it weren't for her this would be a 1-star.D-\",\n",
       " 'This isn\\'t George Lucas vision of Star Wars. Neither is it some talented and visionary directors vision of Star Wars. This isn\\'t even a high budgeted and dedicated fan movie. This is basically just a movie made by a committee - a movie made by a corporation, trying to pander and please as many demographics as possible. Like; we need to have 50% men and 50% women in the movie - we need to have 25% Asians, 25% Africans, 25% Hispanics and 25% Caucasians (who of course mostly should be evil). There needs to be 27% action, 23% humor, 15% suspense, 18% romance, 19% nostalgia etc. We need to get the old fans back, and we need to lure new and young ones in. We need to introduce a certain amount of new cute and cool creatures, characters, weapons and vehicles that can be sold as toys and put on merchandise.That\\'s how I felt when I saw it. Like I was watching the worlds longest and most expensive calculated demographic pander. Not that J. J. Abrams is the most original, deep or visionary director to begin with, he\\'s all ways been a corporate tool, most of his movies basically just feel like empty copy-pasted franchise-related fluff, but with this one, it really felt like he also had a bunch of corporate overlords telling him what to do, how many boxes he had to check and how many demographics he had to please while making the movie.When I heard there was going to be a new trilogy, I was so exited to see my old childhood heroes again. But these movies quickly turned out not to really be about Luke, Han, Leia or the others, they were quickly pushed in the background, their characters changed to fit the narrative, before they were killed one off one by one right from the first movie. We never even got to see them reunited alive on the screen together again, and we were instead told to focus on the the new cast from Captain Planet and the Planeteers.And the new band of heroes just doesn\\'t have the same charm, personalities or chemistry together (actually this is the first movie in the new trilogy, where they do stuff together). They more feel like they have been cast for a United Colors of Benetton commercial, on behalf of their skins-color and sex, more than what type of character and personality they had to portray - they are all just so empty, like cardboard-cutouts with calculated screen-time and one-dimensional personalities. Most of them, hardly even have an arc or any real character-development over the course of 3 movies.And the same goes for the new movie itself. The action is bland, nothing we haven\\'t seen a 100 times before. Often way better and more impressive in other modern movies. Sure it\\'s state of the art, but some of the CGI actually looks rather rushed and unfinished, considering the budget behind this movie, while at other times, there\\'s just too much going on at the screen at once, for you to get involved, focus or care.\\nAnd the action often doesn\\'t serve a purpose to the story - it\\'s just more timely inserted space-battles, chase-scenes and sci-fi fights. Mostly just overblown shiny CGI stuff, with a few practical puppets, sets and costumes thrown in to pander to the old fans.The humor feel as forced and artificial as in the first two new movies, more like the humor you would see in something like Guardians of the Galaxy or Thor Ragnarok, than in Star Wars. Sure the original Star Wars movies also had some humor, but they were never perceived as comedies - in those movies, the funny moments felt natural, like when normal people in the real world make jokes and snappy remarks among each other, or are thrown into unexpected situations together. Not these wink-wink-moments, slapstick humor and juvenile self aware meme-jokes. At times I almost expected Rey to just start using her unignited lightsaber as a microphone and start to rap or Finn to go; \"Palpatine please\".\\nWhat\\'s worse, is that this movie also tries to be dark at the same time, but this isn\\'t Empire Strikes Back or Revenge of the Sith, those movies really were dark chapters in the Star Wars saga, with hardly any humor in them, but in The Rise of Skywalker, it just makes the movie feel even more like a tonal mess, since the movie also tries to be funny, upbeat and happy at the same, making both the humor, the drama and the darker elements feel even more forced and out of place.Without going into spoiler territory, I can tell you this; if you felt that The Force Awakens and Especially The Last Jedi did more damage to the existing Star Wars characters and lore, more than it helped expand it, then you will hate this movie.\\nNot that there\\'s really much to spoil anyway - the shallow Rey and her generic friends, just follow the markings of some convenient new space dagger, which takes them across a bunch of random locations, that leads to some pointless exposition and bland action sequences. Most of these sequences, feel like they could have been put in at any random order, like they were planed and filmed before the story, while most of the story just feel like an excuse to go to try and fill out two hours of more Star Wars - not like this epic, fulfilling and long awaited conclusion to some of the the most important movies in modern pop culture.\\nOr to quote the actor of C3PO Antonio Daniels; \"We\\'ve waited 40 years for THIS?\"\\nBasically, this movie and the new trilogy as a whole, just ruin more for the original saga, than it expands or concludes.And the way they bring back Emperor Palatine is beyond stupid, not to mention his motives and plans, that hardly makes any logical sense. Sure, it\\'s great to see Ian McDiarmid back as Palpatine, though it\\'s basically only like an expanded cameo - but by bringing him back, this movie basically destroys the whole overarching plot of the first 6 movies - with Anakin being the chosen one, fulfilling the prophecy of bringing balance to the force, by helping Palpatine whipping out the Jedi, and then destroying Palpatine and his empire.\\nBringing Back Palpatine felt more like a desperate act from Disney and the producers, to have a major beloved villain back and lure in more old fans, but when they did so, they basically made the plot and the epic story of all the first 6 movies pointless, all 9 movies are basically just a weird mess now story-wise.Actually most of this movie, feels like a jumbled mess, that seem to have gone through countless script-changes, multiple edits and re-shoots. It almost felt like they came up with most of it, as they went along. Often it seems like entire scenes are missing, and we are left without crucial information and explanation. So many questions sat up in both episode VII and VIII are still left unanswered, while this movie still creates more questions and leaves you scratching your head. While also completely disregarding or changing a lot of the lore and \"rules\" of the Star Wars universe - the force and its powers seem to be more or less random now, and its wielders can more or less do anything when it fits the plot.\\nSupposedly Disney also went ahead and started to produce these films, before they even had an entire story planed out for all 3 movies, even though George Lucas all ready had a scripted idea for a new trilogy, that they discarded, to instead go along with something more \"safe\", that they hadn\\'t even planned out first.\\nIf you want to create a trilogy of movies, perhaps, you should have an overall story you wish to tell, before you wish to make a trilogy.\\nInstead of making it up as you go along from movie to movie - and in this episodes case, scene to scene.\\nJust an idea...Though I guess calling your own long time fans out as trolls, Russian bots, racists, homophobes, misogynists and basement dwelling man-babies, just because they voice their disappointment and general critique towards the movies, isn\\'t the best way to strengthen your brand either...So even if you\\'re a huge Star Wars fan, should go and support this movie?\\nThe short answer is no. This is movie-making without soul, without love, and without the desire to tell a story. Without passion.\\nThis is corporate entertainment at its worst. Everything seems calculated. This is only made to sell more plastic and to desperately still keep a major franchise relevant, even though it is clearly loosing its momentum.Maybe we did finally get to see what happened after Return of the Jedi, but the way this trilogy ended out, I would actually have preferred, that they never made these movies - since they just make all the all the battles and sacrifices from the first 6 movies feel pointless now.\\nIf you really are a fan of Star Wars, or movies as an art-form in general, then you shouldn\\'t support this shallow nothingness with your money.\\nTo quote something Mark Hamil said about it on Twitter; \"I would wait till it\\'s out on cable.\"',\n",
       " \"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\",\n",

Historically I felt enriched, but also I felt an overwhelming empathy for my fellow man and the struggles people are going through.

That scene with Cruise trying to break into this vault-like room remains as the one of the better tension-filled scenes I\\'ve ever witnessed on the big screen.The final action scene with the speeding train and helicopter also is very memorable.

       " \"For many sci-fi animated movies, audience captivation is driven purely by world building. Neon scenes and expansive horizons are often used to draw attention from a weak story. Not so in this beautifully animated sci-fi detective drama. The story finds the perfect balance between much loved detective clichés and unexpected turns in a story line, that has no need for smoothing by over hyped futurism. Despite this, the imaginative graphics cleanly place the viewer into the future, pushing us just far enough into the 'what could be' to retain a believability that compliments the story.

       " \"Wicked Little Letters' trailer was really enticing, but unfortunately it was an overpromising highlight reel of the few funny snapshots stowed away from the film's full 1 hour 40 minute runtime. What we're presented with is a lot of underdeveloped filler, not to mention revisionist history spoiling it.The essence of the film (loosely based on a true story) is that a series of offensive letters are posted, and, owing to the period in 1920s Sussex, the dastardly poison-pen cannot easily be traced - leading to an ensuing investigation. The farcical insults themselves were banal and short of wit or creativity. Yes, people of that time would probably be shocked or rattled by any such combination of words, given all the god-fearing and preoccupation with social decorum going on. All the on-screen gawping attests to that being acknowledged. In the 21st century, however, scattered strings of unfunny swear words aren't outrageous zingers, they're just tepidly cliché.The film is hardly faithful to its historical setting either (assuming that's even what it wanted to do), which is perhaps its biggest blunder. Policewoman Gladys Moss was not Indian, yet was cast as such. A black judge would have been virtually impossible, yet one was cast. Among several other people of colour being selected for roles. I wouldn't depict the Zulus with a caucasian man or asian man leading the vanguard, yet here we suffer historical revisionism trashing a promising setting. Every white male was depicted as a flawed buffoon. Women and people of colour were given a far more favourable image. The result is dull, spiritless imbalance.4/10.\",\n",

Watching \"Sixteen Candles\" again as an adult, I was stunned by how racist, sexist and crass most of the movie is. How can it be so revered, I wonder?

       " 'I saw the trailer to \"Past Lives\" before a showing of \"Master Gardener,\" and immediately knew I wanted to see it. I have an affinity for Asian cinema, but more than that, the concept of past lovers reconnecting after decades made for an intriguing premise, one that I had to see unfold on the big screen. And after seeing it unfold (on the big screen), I honestly can\\'t tell how I feel about \"Past Lives,\" which, I guess, means it left me feeling kind of cold.With so many people gushing over this movie, the fact that I fail to see what others are seeing has made me somewhat uncomfortable. I\\'d have loved to witness the \"pitch-perfect romance\" that critics say \"Past Lives\" contains. I wish I managed to see the \"first great film of the year\"; instead, I watched a perfectly watchable film, but one that didn\\'t leave much of an imprint on me. \"Past Lives\" is less a romance and more a dramatic exploration of what could have been. And while that seems like it could be interesting, the unlikeable character of Nora, played by Greta Lee, and the distinctly unromantic and uncomfortable story progression made for a decidedly cringy experience. So, let\\'s start with Nora.Greta Lee is a great actress - there is no doubt about that. The thing is that her character, Nora, is extremely unlikable and unsympathetic. Throughout the course of the entire film she makes mean, borderline cruel choices that put others through the emotional ringer. This left me entirely unsympathetic to her romantic plight - however, I did enjoy Teo Yoo\\'s portrayal as Hae Sung, and especially John Magaro\\'s character of Arthur; both of them play entirely believable and relatable characters who become caught up in situations either of their own doing or of someone else\\'s.As I mentioned, \"Past Lives\" is also remarkably unromantic. Instead of seeing two people fall in love against all odds, you\\'ll witness a bizarre sort of reconnection with a third-wheel that is obviously against everything that\\'s occurring. It\\'s not romantic - purposefully so, I think - but it\\'s also not very fun to watch, which might be the point, but still. The whole \"will they, won\\'t they\" scenario begins to fall short as you\\'ll begin to realize that you don\\'t care whether they will or they won\\'t because of how awkward the entire scenario is. And with an ending that feels more of a fizzle than a bang, when the credits rolled I couldn\\'t help but feel empty. \"That\\'s life,\" the movie seems to say, hoping you simply accept what it\\'s showing you.The more I think about this film, the less I like it, which sucks because I really wanted to like it. Call me a romantic, but I was hoping for a more straightforward love story, and what I got was something that was awkward, uncomfortable, and un-enjoyable.',\n",

       " 'When I asked the reviewer sitting next to me to sum up Revenge of the Sith, he simply said \"great!\" That seemed to basically be the consensus of virtually everyone in attendance at an advance press screening of the final chapter in the Star Wars saga.There was an exuberant mood leaving the theater, as if everyone was in collective agreement that Lucas had finally done it. That he had gone out on top, with a stunning, rock-solid coup de grace. And from all the feedback I\\'ve heard from that screening, my sense of that collective mood was right.There are no real spoilers in ROTS. Everyone basically knows what happens in Episode 4: A New Hope. We all know Anakin becomes Vader. We know Obi Wan lives and we know Luke and Leia are born. What we don\\'t know is how Lucas weaves those story lines into the large, six-part opus and better yet, why?No, it\\'s not a perfect movie. There are those moments that make us cringe. Bad dialog and High School drama class acting make for a few awkward moments where you can hear audible moans and giggles in the audience, but we have come to expect this from modern Star Wars films. The upside is that these moments are rare in Episode III. OK, get ready. Take a deep breath. No Jar Jar! Yes, you read that right. You can let out that deep breath now.Fortunately, we have one savior to rely on for stellar acting. Mr. Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. McDiarmid brings the elegance of an Alec Guiness back to the franchise in a knockout performance that leaves the audience riveted and exhausted. He is the lifeblood of the film.As someone who saw the original 30 times in it\\'s first month of release at the age of 13, I currently consider myself a Star Wars moderate. I don\\'t have volumes of SW merchandise, nor can I debate whether or not carbonite contains enough oxygen to make it float. All I know is that magical feeling Star Wars gave me in the original 1977 release and that I\\'m happy to say, after a disappointing pair of prequels, has been finally restored and reinvigorated.Here\\'s to Mr. Lucas for giving us all something spectacular to remember for our entire lives that embodies the whole point of going to the movies in the first place, to escape and lose ourselves in another world.',\n",
       " 'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original \"Star Wars\" film was released. He doesn\\'t remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn\\'t remember life before it. He does remember the first \"Star Wars\" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he\\'s ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It\\'s now legendary in this boy\\'s family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don\\'t ask...it\\'s a Northern Illinois University thing).I can\\'t review \"Star Wars\" as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There\\'s no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends\\' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda\\'s home.

I suppose this is what most people think, but all the same the film manages to form a satisfying whole; or at least, a whole that satisfies me.  I'm therefore inclined to think it DOES have an ending.  Obviously, I can't discuss this without giving things away to those few who don't know what happens.  If you're one of those few, then believe me: your ignorance is precious enough to be worth guarding until you see the film.  Stop reading now.After the surprise attack on the rebel base, Luke Skywalker splits with Han, Leia, et al.  Han's party gets away first (is it just me, or is the shot of Luke watching the Falcon flying off while he stands stranded on the ground, a poignant one?), but thereafter they face one narrow escape after another, while Luke slinks off quietly and safely to train with Yoda.The training scenes are many and Yoda talks a great deal of rubbish.  But somehow it doesn't matter.  The film is ambivalent in its attitude towards Yoda, anyway.  Our sympathy clearly lies with the entirely non-spiritual concerns of Han, Leia and the adolescent Luke.  The main story concerns the understanding that builds between Han and Leia.  In the end they are honest with one another; and if Han's being frozen and shipped back to Tatooine is the price to pay for this, well, it's the price to pay.  It was very important NOT to end with the dashing rescue that opens `Return of the Jedi', which would be dramatically beside the point.  Instead we end with the promise that the rescue will some day occur.  That's enough.As for Luke: he abandons Yoda to rescue Han and Leia, and achieves NOTHING WHATEVER.  This was my favourite touch.  All five Jedis - Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Vader, and the Emperor - find that their conflicting instincts are all entirely wrong.  The film is really about the temporary triumph of human impulses over the mystical Force.  Luke's human idealism is vindicated, but his supernatural powers, just this once, are not.When George Lucas gave his Star Wars trilogy a fresh coat of varnish in 1997 he felt he had to justify the expense by making needless changes.  You'll notice he made precious few changes to episode V.  There just wasn't room. He added a few extra shots of the ice monster, which of course weakened that one scene; but even with those changes in place the Special Edition is virtually identical to the original edition.  Since Lucas was so keen on making changes wherever he could this is obviously a tribute to the tightness of the story and the direction.  It's also a tribute to the perfection of the original special effects, more innovative than the effects in the first Star Wars movie and better than the effects in any subsequent one.\",\n",
       " \"There's no other word for it...Fox dumped this out, with NO marketing of any kind. Nobody in the country, other than those who have been looking forward to this film, know anything about it. All the red flags have flown. It has to be a mess, it can't be anywhere near as good as Office Space, right? Wrong. Though Office Space it ain't, this film definitely has satirical bite and wit. It's a misfire on certain levels, but who's to blame is left to mystery.Based on what is currently showing in theatres, I can say IDIOCRACY is a good movie. It's funny, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. It's effective, sometimes ingenious. What it isn't as far as I can tell, is finished. We will see something come of this film again, whether it's an extended cut or reshoots. Alone it can be hilarious. It's ballsy at times.Leaving the theatre, looking around at the mall, I was surrounded by advertisements and billboards, commercialism and stupidity. It's not quite as damning a dystopia as 1984, but this movie paints an ugly future for our culture. And there doesn't seem to be much anybody can do about it. Anyway, go see this if you can and try to find out what happened that it was so specifically buried.\",\n",
       " '\"Pearl\" is Ti West\\'s followup to the 1970s-set \"X\", which serves as an origin story for that film\\'s villain. It focuses on her life as a lonely and whimsical young woman who feels stifled by her obligations caring for her family in 1918 Texas while her husband serves in World War I. Pearl\\'s only outlet is the local cinema, where she is invigorated by the glamour of motion pictures and dreams of being a star. Pearl\\'s longing for a more thrilling life--along with some ostensibly psychological predispositions to insanity--drive her to do some unspeakable things.Though branded as a \"Technicolor slasher\" of sorts, \"Pearl\" is, in truth, more of a twisted psychological family drama, and a character study of a deeply sad outsider who feels her life is slipping away from her; her dreams, desires, and impulses out of reach due to her circumstances. This theme was tapped upon in \"X\", which showed the character at the end of her life, and this exploration of where she came from is demented and poignant by turns. The film is notably effective because this existential theme is one that is endemic to being a human--a fear for many that, no matter where we are in our lives, is ever-present--all of the \"what-ifs\", the mourning of \"lost\" time, and even worse: the possibility that where we are is in fact where we belong.This film would not work without Mia Goth\\'s performance, which is truly remarkable. Here, she portrays an outsider anti-hero that is steeped in nuance and conflicting character traits (and flaws). Her ennui and sadness is empathetically played, and one can sense that Goth herself, on some level, identifies with Pearl\\'s pain. She lends the role a potent mixture of naiveté, delicateness, and pure, murderous rage. While Pearl is all of these things, she is also none of them entirely, and thanks to Goth\\'s performance (and the screenplay, which she had a hand in co-crafting with West), the character emerges as multilayered and human despite her propensity for evil. Encircling Goth is a solid supporting cast who are all capable of meeting her intensity with varying degrees of bewilderment, disgust, and sheer terror.\"Pearl\" does indeed edge into slasher territory in its third act, and the film as a whole is a visual feast--garishly colorful, and tipping its hat to a number of films. \"The Wizard of Oz\" is an obvious cornerstone, but there are visual and symbolic nods to \"Repulsion\" and, even more heavily, Frederick Friedel\\'s obscure farm-set \"Axe\", another film that follows a mysterious (and murderous) young woman caring for her infirm grandfather on a rural farm. As with \"X\", West uses these influences smartly without browbeating the audience or pushing the film\\'s content over the edge into pure pastiche, and the film downshifts in its denouement in a way that is unexpectedly touching, despite all the spilt blood and entrails.As a companion piece to \"X\", \"Pearl\" may leave some fans of its predecessor underwhelmed, largely because it is so tonally different and not the conventional \"slasher\" film that might be expected. However, as a nuanced character study of a budding serial killer, it could not possibly be any better. \"Pearl\" stands tall as a disturbing and strangely heartbreaking portrait of a person who, upon finding that her search for meaning and validation from others leads her nowhere, is then only capable of destroying them. 9/10.',\n",
       " \"I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10.\\nParasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there.\",\n",

       " \"Imagine a video game where you are shooting bad guys. Your hardware is old so everything is kind of slow and out of focus. The opponents are set to Easy and you installed a hack to give you invincibility and autoaim. And they come at you slowly, shouting, out in the open, with weapons that fire three or four bullets before they run out and they can shoot anything anyway. They use no snipers, no explosives, no traps of any kind. They can't even hit you when they're next to you and wielding a knife. And you try to fight them in a decent manner, yet your avatar moves like a 60 year old man and even with the autoaim you still suck. And if you somehow get into the many separate levels where nothing make sense, you get a big cinematic that takes you out of it. And because the cinematic is in 4k or whatever, it feels like slow motion.That, my friends, is the experience of watching JW4. The style that people have applauded in the first movie has turned into a demented caricature, the fight scenes are ridiculously bad, the actions of the characters make no sense at all, the world described makes no sense. Not even the tongue-in-cheek references to The Matrix don't hit, because you know that if you enjoyed that film, you're now over 40 and it makes you feel old. The film is three hours of irrelevance.And if you are among the people who I can't understand that rated this film anything above boring, just watch the end credits scene. It destroys the little joy that you might have kept watching this.Bottom line: So many talented people worked on this film. With them on board, I cannot imagine a worse outcome.

       " \"A welcome return to form for the director and James McEvoy gives one of his finest performances. I am not sure how many actors could achieve what he has executed so well here and one wonders if the film could have worked at the highest level without him. In between some of his bigger studio choices he has chosen challenging or interesting roles no matter how the films turn out and his range and talent always keep surprising but he takes it to another level here. I won't reveal too much about the film as others will do that, except to say it was a great film to watch in the theater, full of suspense and in some ways quite touching and meaningful, even if you do or don't like the final twists you'll be drawn in to this story and on the edge of your seat in more of a suspense mode. I wasn't sure if the film would go beyond a typical kidnapping film in the first five minutes but I can assure you its completely different to any expectations you'll have despite the director putting some of his more traditional touches on the film towards the end of it which really work in this case. I've always liked his earlier films as they often look at human conditions or flaws with imagination and some of his films have fallen short but he sounds like he's become more open minded and enjoying his work returning to form so well here and all I can say is well done, he has great attention to detail and gives his all. This is a great film if you want an original suspense/thriller go and see it. I was sorry to see a review that put this film down, those reviews are off the mark this time round in my opinion I hope there is more to come from the M Night daring to be different again, his lower budget work is outstanding and easily brings out his best storytelling. James McEvoy you've smashed it here and given you're all it was worth the risk, keep taking them! Having attended the Q&A he comes across a decent humble man which I would think gives his performances such resonance and skill. Also a great performance from Anya Taylor Joy she's a talent as well. Go see the see the film, especially in the threatre on a big screen it will have you on the edge of your seat.\",\n",

       " \"Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked.\",\n",

       " 'First a word of warning. There are a number of people who would be best advised to avoid Van Helsing. If you dislike cgi, if you\\'re a purist, if you\\'re looking for something \"realistic\", or if you\\'re looking for a slower-moving, understated film that\\'s a deep character study, you\\'ll more than likely hate this film.Set around the turn of the 20th Century, Van Helsing features the titular hero (Hugh Jackman) taking a break from his usual \"monster slayer\" activities, which are commissioned by the Catholic Church, to pursue a grand plot initiated by Dracula (Richard Roxburg) involving the Frankenstein Monster (Shuler Hensley), the Wolf Man (Will Kemp), and the two last surviving members of a Transylvanian family that has long been battling the vampire.Van Helsing is a fast-paced, computer graphics-laden horror/adventure/fantasy film wherein Universal re-imagines its core stable of classic horror characters. I actually like cgi, I\\'m not a purist, I love the genres--I\\'m not looking for realism, and I love fast-paced action-oriented thrill rides as much if not more than I love character studies.As for the character remakes, Van Helsing becomes a slick retro-Matrix-styled macho action hero, part James Bond/007, part Indiana Jones, part Buffy the Vampire Slayer with a secret Catholic Church order filling in for the Watcher\\'s Council and the Bond \"Q Branch\" combined. Dracula becomes a suave, scheming, mad scientist who looks like a romance novel hero. Frankenstein\\'s Monster becomes much closer to Mary Shelley\\'s depiction of an intelligent, loquacious, tormented, slapdash victim of a misguided doctor. And the Wolf Man, when wolf, becomes a cgi generated over-sized, super-agile, hyperactive beast. That should already turn off all of the purists.The look of the film is lush, with lots of unusual point of view shots, exotic locations and computer-generated environments. CGI is used extensively for the human characters in the film as well as the monsters--it\\'s frequently employed to enable physics defying stunts and amazing, far-ranging \"computer camera\" transitions. Van Helsing provides a good argument for such extensive digital assistance, as many of the visuals would be simply impossible to achieve through any other means and substituting some of the creatures with mechanicals, animatronics, special effects makeup and the like would have caused the film to go far over its already outrageous estimated budget of 160 million.The plot, while not deep on characterization, couldn\\'t be more full of events and action. Combined with the extravagant visuals and quickly changing, sprawling locations, the result is epic in scope. Director/writer Stephen Sommers, who was also responsible for remaking the image of another classic Universal character in The Mummy (1999) and The Mummy Returns (2001) (probably the reason the Mummy is not present in here), begins Van Helsing in a black and white scene that wonderfully recreates the feel of the James Whale-lensed Frankenstein films, including referencing a number of shots, scenes and characters from those classics.After the titles, we move into a color-filled world ala The Wizard of Oz while we\\'re treated to a brief character-establishing scene of Van Helsing battling Mr. Hyde in the bell tower of Notre Dame. Sommers then quickly whisks us away to the Vatican, where Van Helsing receives his orders.This whirlwind beginning can be almost overwhelming--it certainly is visually--and it takes a moment to get up to speed and catch our breath, but once we settle into the town square of Transylvania, we\\'re enraptured by the story and the pacing reaches a more sustainable level. Although fantastical at heart, the performances from the principle cast members help anchor the film in \"reality\". Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Roxburgh, Henley and David Wenham all turn in nuanced performances that imply the depth of character that the film does not have the time to fully explore.The intense action throughout the film combined with the cgi and spectacular sweeping camera moves often gives Van Helsing a feel somewhere between a comic book film and a video game. That fact might turn some viewers off, but as innovative, suspenseful, exciting filmic art, this is years ahead of most other recent releases. In fact, the sophisticated technological wizardry and entrancing epic storytelling is somewhat reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings films, which makes me wonder just what other viewers see in those to enable them to consistently sit high on the IMDb Top 250 list while Van Helsing struggles to attain a slightly above average rating. Perhaps Van Helsing deserves a more tempered first or second viewing from those who have summarily dismissed it due to unjustified expectations/preconceptions. This really is an outstanding film that at least deserves to be appreciated on a technical level, and should be easy enough to enjoy for its action-oriented storytelling prowess as well.',\n",
       " 'Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who\\'s leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn\\'t feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm\\'s Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word \"epic\" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what\\'s going on.10/10',\n",

While I can see how this can speak to a certain audience, it didn\\'t appeal to me and made me want to turn of the movie quite a few times.

       " \"Aquaman and The Lost of Kingdom suffers THE SAME problem with the first installment; it DOES NOT have a distinct identity. We were shocked to see that the major problem they had in Aquaman 1 was again manifested in this sequel. If you watch a film, you know the kind of tone and feel that a movie is giving you. But this movie feels like a jumbled medley of imitations from different kinds of films, almost like a parody. There's a 10-minute scene where you felt like this is from an Indiana Jones world, and then the next thing you know, you're stuck in the realm of Journey 2: The Mysterious Island. We can name a lot of different movies that this film takes its tone and design and pastes it into the movie. War of the Worlds, The Matrix Revolutions, Ridley Scott's Aliens and... okay, we'll stop now. The result is an endless patchwork of downgraded recreations from various movies. It felt like Aquaman had a day at Disneyland going into different kind of movie-themed rides (minus the 'fun').Adding to that, the first act felt like it was venturing into a documentary style format mixed with Ridley Scott's Alien style of exposition. Alien was a masterpiece but like we said, this is a dumpster reiteration, it was slow, it had little to no suspense, it tried to build momentum but it didn't work. They could have cut 10 minutes but they didn't. It was unnecessarily drawn out as they spent time showing the entirety of their journey into the deep unknown like this is some kind of art house film.Now, a lot are asking, is Amber Heard in it? Well, yes. Did she have many scenes? Her presence was only about 15% of the whole film. Her character, Mera did play a pivotal role for the story but James Wan, the director knew when to show her on screen. The question, 'Is her presence important on screen?' seems like what James Wan would ask himself before making the decision to put her in. She only had few dialogues but her performance was still flat.We also have a problem with how much they made use of 'space'. Especially in the first act, we saw they're a lot of wide shots used but the issue here is the space that filled in those shots; the surroundings, locations or/and environments were only there because... they were made to be there. It barely did anything to the story. But when it comes to scenes that were crowded or had various props or extras, the cameras ddin't give audience the time to breathe and process the visuals. A lot of mid to fast cuts, there wasn't much of a sense of appreciation to enjoy the visuals they have built. In the end, we felt discontented.First Aquaman at least had villains that were enjoyable to watch. This time, the villain or again, villains were just forgettable. The motivations were weak. The main villain didn't really drive the story forward. It had a backstory and conflict that were created merely for the purpose of this movie's existence. We couldn't care less because it's nowhere interesting, let alone enjoyable.And talking about that final battle... oh man. It was unbearable to the point that it turned laughable. Was it because of the reshoots that they suffered here? The whole movie, led to the final battle, it was a journey between Aquaman and his brother, only for us to find out that the villain was feeble and it gave the benefit of the plot armor for Aquaman and his weapon. It's just bad storytelling on top of bad execution overall.And the movie draggggggsssssss so much, we even questioned, 'What happened to James Wan?' From the beginning up until the climax, we were just waiting for something cool or unique to happen, but it didn't. It drags until the final battle where it should be longer but then that's when they decided to just cut things off and ended it abruptly the moment the exciting thing was about to pop up. We're confused.Amidst these flaws, one thing that truly stood out is its message on brotherhood. A beautiful message combo with good pairing, Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson have commendable chemistry, we can see it from the way they talk to each other. There's certainly some dedication they put into establishing their relationship. It's nothing that you can remember for years but it's enough to at least carry this movie despite the many bad outcomes this movie turned out to be.Ultimately, Aquaman 2 seems tailored for a younger audience who just want to enjoy monsters and sea creatures fighting against literally anything or anyone, rather than catering to teenagers or adults seeking a compelling narrative.Verdict: Similar to its predecessor, this sequel fails to find its identity, drowning in an ocean of borrowed tones and styles from previous movies. With a shallow story, forgettable villains and inconsistent pacing, this film struggles to stay afloat. While it's a tidal wave of disappointing results, the portrayal of brotherhood between the two leads stands out as a beacon, carrying the entire movie. Overall, this final chapter from the DCEU serves as a testament we're in dire need for a total reboot of these superheroes.\",\n",
       " \"Triangle of Sadness has received much critical acclaim and comes around with a plot that sounds interesting on paper. The truth is however that this movie is vapid, pretentious and exhausting drivel that doesn't deserve the attention it's getting. Let me point out how I have come to this conclusion.First of all, the movie exaggeratedly tries to criticize contemporary society. The world of modeling is fake and superficial. Influencers are self-consumed and shallow. The rich and famous are greedy and soulless. The poor are jealous and vengeful. This movie brings up so many tired old stereotypes that it doesn't become a satire of contemporary society but rather a satire of its very own kind: pretentiously moralizing films attempting to please trendy prejudices.Up next, this film is unbearably long and clocks in at two and a half hours. We are witnessing models doing a casting for ten minutes. We are watching a toxic couple arguing over financial matters for twenty minutes. We are introduced to a whole range of characters on a yacht for forty-five minutes. Depth there is none. Development there is none. Entertainment there is none.The characters are meant to be antipathic. However, they are never fleshed out and remain dreadfully shallow to a point that viewers will simply not care about their fates at all. Their actions, discussions and motivations keep repeating themselves endlessly. Few movies have ever had so many redundant dialogues as this one.The acting performances also remain mostly shallow. A positive exception is Dolly de Leon who shines as manipulative antagonist in the last third of the movie but is nowhere to be seen before. Harris Dickinson disappoints as protagonist since he doesn't have any charisma whatsoever. His looks are boring, his facial expressions are repetitive and his delivery is redundant. That isn't anything new however since he already couldn't convince in previous features such as The King's Man and See How They Run. Lead actress Charlbi Dean tragically died much too young. If we strictly talk about her acting skills however, she also doesn't have the charisma to carry this movie. She often overacts in an artificial way which becomes nerve-firing through two and a half hours. She never becomes one with her role and instead establishes a distance to it that makes it obvious that she is acting. Talented actresses and actors on the other side are underused in this movie. Woody Harrelson is limited to the role of a drunk captain who keeps yelling nonsense through a closed cabin door time and again. Iris Berben is limited to repeating the same seven words over and over again since she is playing a character that suffered from a stroke and can't express herself very well. The casting choices for this movie have been absolutely dreadful in my opinion.At the end of the day, I would highly recommend you to avoid watching Triangle of Sadness. This movie doesn't live up to its exaggeratedly positive reception. This film doesn't even know what it wants to be: adventure film, black comedy, survival drama, contemporary satire, you name it. Ultimately, this film is nothing but bloated, pretentious and shallow. Even its concept offers nothing new. You would be much better off reading Lord of the Flies or even Robinson Crusoe if you are interested in an analysis of society in a context of isolation. If you absolutely want to watch a contemporary movie with a similar concept, go for Chinese production The Island. The movie is good to very good but compared to the disasterpiece Triangle of Sadness, it almost feels like watching a masterpiece.\",\n",
       " \"Maybe it's because I had higher expectations for episode VII and almost none for this one, I feel like this movie managed to achieve what the other one couldn't.I'm not saying that it was perfect, but it sure was good enough for me, and it will be good enough for many other die-hard SW fans. Leading female actor wasn't that good in my opinion, but otherwise this movie had everything a SW fan could wish for. Good old characters, good old places, and an overall good old SW feeling. Fits into the story line quite well, CGI was a bold move , could've gone bad, but it played out quite nicely. Overall I think SW fans will love it, but anybody not deeply immersed in the saga would also enjoy it.\",\n",
       " 'This film is one of a kind.  After seeing this film last week, I was left with a hole in the pit of my stomach.  It left many questions in my mind, and most of them cannot be answered. In my view, a film that makes me think after I watch it is second-to-none, and this film certainly delivers in that aspect.I was amazed with the vivid imagery in this movie, as well as with the symbolism.  However, what makes this film the best of 1999 is the acting. Kevin Spacey shines as Lester Burnham, and Annette Bening (Carolyn Burnham) isn\\'t far behind.  Supporting cast members such as Wes Bentley (Ricky Fitts), Thora Birch (Jane Burnham), Mena Suvari (Angela Hayes), and Chris Cooper (Col. Frank Fitts) only add to the drama of this film.  I think the most special aspect of this film is how all of the characters intertwine in a way that is believable, yet fantastic at the same time.  I congratulate Sam Mendes for his direction of this film, as well as Alan Ball for writing it.  I don\\'t think it could have been any better.Rated R in the U.S. for strong sexuality, language, drug content, and violence, the film obviously deserves its rating.  However, none of the causes for the R rating are overbearing, and all of them add to the plot-line of this film.  While I don\\'t think that this is a film for children, I would suggest that adults should view it with an open mind.  I believe that the traits which many of the characters in this film have are found in many people around the world. Perhaps that is why this film hits close to home for so many viewers.While billed by some as a \"comedy-drama\", I don\\'t see anything about this film as funny.  Sure, there are some comedic moments, but by the end, those moments were all but forgotten when faced with the grim reality of the conclusion of the events portrayed in this film.If you want to watch a light-hearted film with some elements of comedy and some elements of drama, don\\'t see American Beauty.  But if you enjoy films that make you think, and are entertained by an excellent cast, excellent directing, and an excellent screenplay, this film should be at the top of your list.My Rating:  10/10',\n",
       " 'Have you ever disagreed with someone about the quality of a production so intensely that you\\'ve wondered if the two of you even watched the same film? I\\'m sorry, everyone in the world, I thought The Force Awakens was a real snoozer. I\\'m not surprised that my eight year old nephew loved it, but I can\\'t for the life of me figure out why the adults I associate with aren\\'t offended at what we\\'ve been offered by Abrams as the continuation of the world\\'s foremost loved space epic. Essentially what it feels like is a reboot of the original series, except this time for kids (no surprise there, Disney), not a meaningful continuation that picks up where the originals left off. Although I did start having my doubts about my future satisfaction with the Star Wars franchise when Disney made its Star Wars paraphernalia so pervasive that one morning I found myself unconsciously buttering my toast with DeathStar Margarine Spread©. Yeah—head trip, but I got over it. There was virtually zero discussion within the movie itself as to what happened after episode Vl and how we got to where we are now, making this production feel like a desperate lurch to be a stand-alone and to appeal to an audience who is too young to have appreciated the Spice Girls let alone the originals. This direction may be satisfying for some, but for those of us who were expecting more will find ourselves disappointed. Furthermore, I was saddened by the obvious deficiency surrounding the exploration of the mythology of the Force. One of the elements that so intrigued viewers about the originals was the underlying spirituality and the metaphysical forces at play within the Star Wars universe; however, in this version of Star Wars Abrams seems to care more about the characters ceaselessly running away from things and having meaningless, often silly conversation (like in one scene the character Finn asks Rey in the goofiest way possible if she has a boyfriend—I laughed but I was so ashamed) instead of exploring the depths of some of the most intriguing supernatural philosophy in all of moviedom. However, this fact is not surprising as the masses seem to be entertained predominantly by action, comedy, flashing lights, and explosions, not exploring the psychological latitudes of light and dark within the human soul, and definitely not sitting through slow scenes of dialogue which could (God forbid) give us an understanding of the depths of the Star Wars legend and mystery. I suppose in this regard (and in too many others) Abrams gave the people what they wanted.Not only was the confined exploration of the Force disappointing but so was the serious lack of emotional poignancy. At no point, AT LITERALLY NO POINT, did I feel sad, frustrated, anxious, worried, or exhilarated during its belabored two hours and sixteen minutes. The characters felt like they could be potentially cloned from any PG-13 teen movie you\\'ve seen since Twilight hijacked the world and forced it\\'s twisted, disgusting version of acceptable adolescent stereotypes upon us. You could almost swap out the light-sabers, tie-fighters, and storm troopers and you\\'d have a great sequel to whatever the hell number Hunger Games we\\'re on these days (because that\\'s how interesting the rest of the plot was). Another thing that really annoyed me was the way in which the galaxy was too American. Of course I get it, it was made by Hollywood IT IS American, but guys, this is supposed to be in a GALAXY FAR AWAY, so why was there very little attempt made to try and hide that? Between the all too familiar mannerisms, jokes, and language I just couldn\\'t fully suspend my disbelief. In my opinion, the originals managed to avoid most overt use of cultural indicators, I mean sure, it\\'s impossible to avoid all due to obvious limitations, but watch the main character Finn carefully during the movie and you\\'ll see that he\\'s dripping with 21st century western American dude. Like literally drenched. Where was the otherworldly authenticity among the main characters? Of course it wasn\\'t all bad. The visuals were beautiful, much of the topography and effects were breathtaking, and I have to admit that I did feel pangs of nostalgia over any scene that included an X-wing, but overall it wasn\\'t enough. Really a lot of what it comes down to is expectation. So many people have told me that they went into it not expecting too much and that they had \"fun\" watching it; and then there\\'s me sitting here thinking: what on Tatooine are they talking about? With all the media hype this film received, not to mention the disappointment of the prequels, I was expecting a hell of a lot out of this movie, and simple fun ain\\'t gonna cut it. Abrams seemed to have carved the profundity and soul out of Star Wars with a lightsaber— the same soul we\\'ve been waiting to enter our lives again ever since the prequels ruined them. The Force Awakens was half way there, but it felt forced (pun intended), shallow, in need of a more refined plot, more mature characters, a deeper spirituality, moral complexity and depth; it needed to resonate more deeply with the IMPORTANT themes of the original, and to not have felt like a chaste teen romance with some old faces in there used like a box office tractor beam. If you\\'re content with having your childhood favorite epic turned into a lovable, easily digestible icon of twenty-first century pop culture, marketed intentionally at young people to delight and entertain whilst simultaneously causing you to cringe at the fact that the original actors are okay with such a disservice to a beloved story, then you will enjoy the continuation of this franchise. May the force save us from this trilogy.',\n",
       " \"This is a thinking person's movie. It's largely dialogue heavy and not afraid to take its time. It's a movie that takes itself seriously. It's the kind of smart movie that confuses critics who prefer light easy-to-digest popcorn entertainment. When it shifts into full thriller or action mode, brace yourself, because it gets totally intense.Director Shyamalan doesn't get much respect from the critics, but screw the critics, he did brilliantly here from writing to directing.And James McAvoy deserves every acting award for 2019. Might as well just give him all of them now, best actor, best actress, best child actor, etc., all of them, because no one's topping this performance.And about the action, I saw director Shyamalan talking in an interview about how he's mainly interested in drama and that action is not his strong point, but he was really downplaying his handling of the action, because the fight scenes here are legitimately awesome. Glass thankfully features none of the shaky rapid-editing style that plagues so many other action movies. It is all well shot, so you'll have no trouble following the action. We even see lots of unusually artistic camera shots during the action, such as showing long close up shots of people's faces while they're in the middle of fighting. My favorite was a long held shot from the point of view of being inside a van while we're seeing a fight happening outside, as the combatants are circling around and slamming into the van. That was just plain cool, the kind of shot that's just mind-boggling to think about how they managed to pull it off.And don't trust the rotten critics. Just don't. They're so worthless, those critics. They're wrong about almost every movie these days. Glass just continues the critics' rotten streak of being totally out of touch with what's really good or bad.\",\n",

       " \"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled.

It tries to tell you they\\'re madly in love, but it\\'s just a weird sexual relationship.Drama: 1/10. there is no thrill.. no intense things going on. There is no drama in this soft-core-erotic-drama. \"The deeds\" 10/10.. they did it. so.. can\\'t give it any lower points than this. Overall, it\\'s was horrible acted, plot-less, non-romantic nor drama movie about a girl being horny and the guy doing an attempt of BDSM, which comes down to.. soft-core.. almost nothing different than normal sex with bondage.. boring sh*t. on that note, go watch the kings man; secret service. that\\'s one of the best action movies i\\'ve seen in a while!',\n",

But they also did touch on some of the tougher material - but maybe didn\\'t dwell on it as much as the critics would like. We don\\'t witness his ill health and death, but do we really need to? I don\\'t think so.Lots of references and small touches that will resonate with those who know his story well, that may be missed by others. If you know, you know and that adds an extra layer, but none of that knowledge is needed to enjoy the movie.The soundtrack is of course fantastic and acts as a narrative through the movie, there is emotion, joy and a clear mission.A very well executed, and acted, biopic that although pulls a few punches, doesn\\'t fail to entertain and give the viewer a window into Marley.

       " 'Just prior to graduating with a degree in Film Studies a lecturer asked us, \"So what\\'s your favourite film now?\" Whilst my peers spouted out Goddard films and obscure German expressionist shorts I sat quietly thinking; my favourite film has been My Favourite Film since I was seven... So when it came to me and I mumbled \"The Goonies\", I was expecting scorn, ridicule and possibly minor injury, but instead was met with concurring shouts and whoops and cries of \"Hey you gu-uys!\" from the rest of the class. You see this is the unifying thing about The Goonies; mention it in a room full of twenty-somethings and they\\'ll whell up and utter \"Sloth loves Chunk\" or adopt a harassed Chinese tone \"Thats what I said...Booty traps!\". And if that room happens to be a pub, several chairs will scrape back and semi-inebriated grown men will lift their shirts, shake their bellies and revel in the truffle shuffle. People may say it\\'s an Indiana Jones wanna-be I think that is the defining beauty of it all. When we first watched The Goonies it was like watching our dreams come true on screen! We\\'d loved seeing Indiana\\'s adventures and escapades and in The Goonies we saw kids like us actually doing it! They got to be just like the mini-Indies we imagined ourselves to be in the playground. But its not just the adventure that makes us love the film, we love those Goonies themselves. They were like our friends. We got annoyed with them sometimes, and we wanted to protect them, and we laughed at their jokes and cheered when they had a brilliant plan. Identifying with those kids was what we loved and why, as adults, we quote them and \\'become\\' them when talking about the film. I still want to be like Andy, having a perilous adventure sliding down tunnels and facing the bad guys on a huge pirate ship... but of course also making time to kiss Brand AND Mikey! I also think that this is why Goonies 2 is such a relevant and exciting concept. We\\'ve all grown up together and I\\'d love to see how the guys are doing now...I just hope it doesn\\'t disappoint...

       " 'The movie, \"Se7en\", starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichés. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri\\'s seven deadly sins from \"The Divine Comedy\", sets out to, \"preach\" about man\\'s impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film\\'s conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en\\'s surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en\\'s poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90\\'s. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.Score 10/10',\n",

Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks. A love letter to all things Spider-Man.Tom Holland gives an incredible lead performance once again, reliably charming and likeable but with a lot more emotional heft this time around. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and are also incredible in their own ways.Benedict Cumberbatch reaffirms why he's such a good Doctor Strange with his excellent dry wit and gravitas. All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the standout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence.Jon Watts' direction is superb, the action sequences are thrillingly acrobatic once again but refreshingly impactful this time around. There's a few homages to the styles of the previous iterations and some gorgeous imagery.It's also perfectly paced with none of its roughly 2hr 30 minute runtime feeling dull or overly long due to a strong momentum established early on. The CG is extremely impressive with only a few weak spots.The music by Michael Giacchino is fantastic, a nice balance of themes from the previous iterations and use of Holland's iconic motifs which are slightly altered in ways that work as well as a few new additions that are beautifully epic.\",\n",

       " \"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10\",\n",

       " \"*** 1/2 out of ****After so many years The Road Warrior still remains one of the most exhilarating action films to ever grace the screen.  The car chases are as excitingly pulse-pounding as ever and no film has yet to surpass the final chase as the best in movie history.  Yes, in terms of pure action, not many films have been able to equal The Road Warrior's thrills.The film takes place presumably years after the conclusion of Mad Max.  The world has been devastated by a third world war and has suffered a setback by he rarity of gasoline. The loner, Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) is still wandering around the Australian wasteland, thousands of miles from civilization, in search of gasoline.  He comes across a gyro-pilot (Bruce Spence), who tells him of a compound that's producing fuel.Max brings the pilot along with him and studies the compound from atop a cliff.  It seems a large gang also wants the gasoline and has been besieging the refinery for a long time now.  They are a pack of madmen, led by the Humungus, a hugely muscular man who wears a hockey mask to cover his face. An attempt is made by the people inside the compound to find a rig large enough to haul the fuel but the effort is brought down when Humungus' men take down all the cars.Max, finding a perfect moment to strike a bargain, makes a deal with one of the survivors and makes it to the compound.  Eventually, he makes another deal there, as he tells the people inside that in return for as much gasoline as he can carry, he'll bring the rig to them.  What follows is classic edge-of-the-seat action entertainment.Having inspired dozens of rip-offs, The Road Warrior still remains the best of the bunch due to the great lead performance from Mel Gibson and the unrivalled car chases, which are very much worth mentioning.  The movie begins with a rousing commentary over the events that led to the destruction of government.  What follows next is a short and exciting car chase.  True, the following half-hour does move by a bit slowly, but it all builds up to a lightning paced final 45 minutes.The final chase, in particular, is an exercise in action craftsmanship. Director George Miller has staged one of the most brilliant and downright exciting action scenes ever.  So many spectacular stunts and on-road carnage occur during this sequence, to describe it simply wouldn't do it justice.Miller's cinematography is decidedly Un-Hollywood.  He gives us many breathtaking camera angles, some of which are sometimes a bit shaky, which serves to make the action even more involving.  Looking back at the film now, it might not appeal to a wide range of viewers.  The odd characters (mainly the villains), ultra-violence, dark tone, and the sparse dialogue may seem a little too offbeat for some people.Mel Gibson remains the only world-renowned actor in the whole film.  He does a terrific job as the character Max, one of his best and most interesting characters.  The development of Max is another intriguing component of The Road Warrior, and serves the film by giving it a human edge by featuring Max's slow transformation from loner to savior.  Not only that, Gibson also creates a great action hero.  There's not a moment in the film when we aren't rooting for Max to smash Humungus and his gang. Bruce Spence as the gyro-pilot is decent in his role and offers the film's few humorous moments.Virginia Hey is also pretty good as the Warrior Woman, and though the script doesn't exactly give her a lot to do, she plays the part well.  Mike Preston also shows a lot of honor as the compound's leader.On the other side of the equation are the actors who portray the villains. Surprisingly enough, though the characters are outlandish, no one ever goes over-the-top.  Vernon Wells and Kjell Nilson are absolutely menacing and frightening as the lead villains, Wez and Humungus.  They personify evil itself, creating characters who we truly grow to despise.To be honest, I am a little surprised that the critics enjoyed this every bit as much as I did.  The film doesn't delve very deeply into philosophical issues and doesn't exactly have a lot of grand things to say.  I suppose with the acclaim this film received goes to show that critics do truly watch movies primarily for entertainment.As I mentioned before, the film was the benchmark of a genre that grew in popularity.  The premise of a loner helping a group of people in need has been used a bit too much now.  Most notably is the big-budget flop, Waterworld (which is a good movie I recommend), though none have yet to match the outright intensity of The Road Warrior.\",\n",
       " \"We waited so long for this movie to be made, ever since Daniel James Brown wrote the story. A serendipitous set of events led to the story even being recorded, as Judy Rantz Willman just happened to have Daniel James Brown as a neighbor, and eventually persuaded Brown to visit her father, who was in hospice care. What he thought was a social visit, she saw as a book about to be written. His initial skepticism evaporated quickly, when Joe began sharing his story. In Joe's remaining couple of months of life, Brown met with Rantz several times to begin creating the outline for the book. He then met with the families of the other crew members, followed by two years of further research, aided by Judy Rantz. The eight were amazing people, accustomed to hardship and personal challenges. For example, when Don Hume's family moved from Anacortes to Olympia, Don tossed his belongings into a rowboat and paddled down Puget Sound to his new home, roughly 100 miles away. Look at a map! A multiple-sport letterman in high school, he had also placed third in a state pianist's competition. And Joe Rantz was such a standout athlete in gymnastics at Roosevelt High School, that Coach Ulbrickson already had his eye on him then. So, what did we miss in the movie? Joe's difficult pre-college life is mostly absent, and worth the read by itself. We also miss Joe's wanderings around Berlin, where he witnesses Germany's horrific treatment of its Jewish population, under its totalitarian leader. Like nearly everything from Hollywood, a bit of romance is thrown in to add spice, but the story shines, throughout the picture. Here and there a bit of drama is added for effect, but personalities presented by the actors conform closely with who they represented. George Pocock really was the sage he seemed in the movie. Don Hume comes across as a bit socially awkward in the movie. A good friend met him several years ago where she worked, and described him as, uh, gruff. The fearless audacity of the team comes through in a story told only in the book. Before sailing to Germany for the Olympics, the team decides to drop in, unannounced, on Franklin Roosevelt at his home. Although they didn't find the president at home, they did spend the evening there. The story behind this movie is too remarkably wonderful to be fiction. See the movie, but by all means read the book!\",\n",
       " \"When I was a young boy of eight years old I saw this at my my local cinema . In those days it cost 15 pence ( A fair amount of money for an eight year old child ) to get in . I actually saw it two or three times which eat up my pocket money bit I certainly thought it was money well spent since in those days I enjoyed war films and monster films . Yesterday morning Channel 4 broadcast it at 6 am which seems a ridiculous time to broadcast anything never mind a fondly remembered fantasy adventure movie but I looked forward to seeing it again if only to see how well it stands up as entertainment today . Would my cherished memories be hurt ? Do I have nice memories about THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT simply down to nostalgia ? To be honest I think the answer is a resounding no . Right from the opening title sequence where Douglas Gamley's score sums up the downbeat feature of the story we the audience are treated to a fantasy adventure that is a little bit different . You could point out the first half of the movie is somewhat repetitive as the Germans and Brits get one over on one another but in amongst all this is some serious debate on wartime morality , allied civilian ships carrying weapons of war for example which shows no one has a monopoly on self righteousness when the battle lines are drawn and the theories of Nietzsche are also touched upon . What'd you mean this is a childish film ? No doubt the people who watched this at the cinema on its release where more interested in prehistoric monsters than 19th century philosophy and it's not till half way through that the U-boat reaches the ancient island of Caprona which is inhabited by rubber dinosaurs and troglodytes . Yeah okay the monsters especially the pterodactyls are not very convincing but I've seen worse . It's also interesting to that this part of the movie replaces Nietzsche with Darwinisnm and I don't know if it's deliberate but this concept fits in perfectly well with the sequel THE PEOPLE THAT TIME FORGOT . How many times have you seen a sequel that almost contradicts the original movie ? This makes THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT something of a stand out movie alongside the very pessimistic final act I fail to see how anyone can actively dislike this movie . I agree that the special effects are far from brilliant but look beyond the FX and you'll see a very intelligent piece of fantasy adventure . The very fact that it has a sense of wonder and a truly haunting ending sets it apart from many other movies of its ilk like WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS and AT THE EARTHS CORE and nostalgia or not I certainly enjoyed seeing it again\",\n",
       " \"THE sci-fi movie. It's nearly perfect in every way: storyline, characters, menacing threat, suspense, action, direction, music, emotion, etc... It's always been a favorite of mine and still is. To me this is not just a film, it is an experience. The adrenaline pumps like in no other film and rarely have we had the chance to see a heroine as compelling as Sigourney Weaver. She can kick anyone's ass and still keep a heart and soul. (Why she didn't win the Oscar back in 1986 is beyond me.) When the action starts, you're in for the ride of your life. Truly a milestone in movie making. Now if they could only release it on DVD...\",\n",
       " 'I don\\'t know why I loved this movie so much.  Maybe it was the utter amazement when I first saw the Brachiosaurus eat from a tree.  Or maybe it was my adrenaline rushing when two 12 year old were attacked by velociraptors.  It might possibly be the chills that went down my spine when the T-Rex first made his terrifying roar.  Whatever it was, it made me write this review.Allan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie (Laura Dern) are two successful paleontologists who are asked by a rich man John Hammond to come at his park for a major tour.  They agree and are taken to an island where \"Jurassic Park\" logos are everywhere.  The two paleontologists have no idea what they are getting themselves into.  The first dinosaur to make an apearance is the Brachiosaurus, which both of them are extrememly amazed by its giant apearance, and so is the audience.  What the two of them don\\'t know is that there are much more terrifying and carnivorous dinosaurs who are about to escape and run loose....Directed by the mighty Steven Speilberg, Jurassic Park relied on more character development than any other creature-feature.  Usually you get second-rate actors who can\\'t act, getting terrified by monsters that don\\'t really exist.  Jurassic Park was the opposite.  It changed the way we looked at the world, and it will forever.  Based on the novel by Micheal Crichton, Jurassic Park was an amazing movie.From beginning to end, Jurassic Park bedazzled us with dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs that are EXTINCT.  There are a lot of cool cameos and the stars give great performances.  The whole family should watch this movie.  Not for the glossy title, but because of the dinosaurs.  I remember being a kid when I first watched it, and I remember loving this movie so bad.  The climax was excellent, and I am not saying what happens, unlike the sequel to this film (Jurassic Park 3).  A climax-less bad film, that was.  But this....this was magic.  And yes, it was a masterpiece.The magic of this film is what brought me into dinosaurs, too.  I had a \"Jurassic Park\" marathon today and I watched this movie, and I can still feel the magic.  You will feel the magic too once you see it.  I just have absolutely nothing to say except that Steven Speilberg will put a spell on you.  Even if you don\\'t like creature-features, this movie will entertain you.  Steven Speilberg will take you to places that no one else ever will. And the \"life will find a way\" speech is here, ready to make someone feel that creating dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years is a good thing.Absolutely needless to say, Jurassic Park was a golden diamond.10/10 (One of the greatest films ever made)',\n",
       " \"Gone Girl marks Fincher's tenth feature film and his most mature work since Fight Club. Centering on Nick Dunne, a husband desperately trying to find his wife all while having police and media accuse him of murder. The story sounds straight out of the Scott Peterson case and the film looks unlike any film I've seen in recent years. Lead by an all star cast featuring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris, Gone Girl rises above the pack with smart storytelling, phenomenal pacing and perfect performances. What Gone Girl does so brilliantly is taps into the audience's psyche regarding marriage and the ideology behind a sanctioned union that is corrupt. It is really heavy stuff when the story really gets to the meat and bones of it all. With plenty of twists and turns, Gone Girl keeps you, not only second guessing the whole idea of marriage, but the intentions of every character in the film. It is truly one of the most twisted films adapted from an even sicker and twisted book that's out there right now. Gillian Flynn does wonders with her adaption from her own novel. The dialog is crisp, the characters are multi-layered, it truly is a pitch perfect script that doesn't have one false moment in it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are EXCELLENT in this film. This is a different Affleck, a very human and realized Affleck. Nick Dunne is a wonderful role for him and captivates just how good he can be with a terrific director. Harris and Perry give well rounded performances as well but are nothing compared to Affleck and Pike. David Fincher and his long time collaborator and cinematographer, Jeff Cronenweth create a dreary, horrific tone for Gone Girl that makes every twist and turn that much more gut wrenching. Every shot is meticulously planned, showing each shot as if it were a still frame that spoke a thousand words. It is truly gorgeous filmmaking. And now for the score...Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch deliver a perfect score, besting their Social Network and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo score. If Reznor won for Social Network, I fully expect not only a nomination but a win for this film. Overall, this is a mesmerizing film that demands multiple viewings to truly get the full experience. It is impeccably made, beautifully acted and an all around near perfect film.\",\n",
       " \"Screened FRebruary 23 for Australian Media.There's no reason for me to expect I was going to like Watchmen. I knew the cast was interesting - Patrick Wilson has made smart film choices that don't rely on or intentionally subvert his good looks (Hard Candy, Little Children); Jackie Earle Haley was icky in Little Children (and I'm old enough to remember him from Breaking Away); Malin Akerman is cute but 28 Dresses and The Heartbreak Kid do not a superhero make; Jeffery Dean Morgan, Matthew Goode - ??? And director Zack Snyder did cool things with zombies in Dawn Of The Dead and made a wild and wacky movie in 300, which totally indicated his third film was probably going to be worth a look, but...you know, whatever...So they all signed up for Watchmen - based on a comic bo...sorry, graphic novel...that I'd never read and that was coming to theatres less than a year after Ironman and The Dark Knight had redefined how good superhero movies could (and should, from here on in) aspire to be.That Watchmen has turned out to be the most complex, exhilarating and deeply-moving fantasy film since Terry Gilliam's Brazil surprises nobody on Earth more than me - and, man, did it surprise.In equal measure, it is a) an inspired vision of an alternate world that echoes but redefines our own existence; b) a subversive yet bracingly humanistic exploration of the role of the superhero in modern literature, c) a supremely adult take on the fetishistic pull of the heightened existence that life as a saviour of society creates, and d) a wildly exciting adventure story that turns normal people into exaggerated victims of their own creation and then back into mere humans.An exploration of the plot would reveal more vast themes, but at this early stage of its release I don't want to risk lessening the experience for anyone.I can reveal this - Billy Crudup as Dr Manhattan and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach create characters every bit as captivating (and deserving of Oscar recognition) as Heath Ledger's Joker; Malin Akerman makes an entrance to the world of superhero timelessness that will be the fantasy of every teenage boy, aged 15 to 50; and from the flawless art direction, set design and special effects to a mesmerising soundtrack, Watchmen is a film that revels in the perfection of minor details.Be warned - those expecting Spiderman-like teen-angst or Fantastic Four-like silliness will be stunned, perhaps not quite sure of what they have found. Watchmen is an extraordinarily mature, risky project for Hollywood to role the dice on, especially given similarly-complex explorations of social collapse and vigilantism (V For Vendetta, most specifically) have failed to do blockbuster numbers.But Watchmen is something special and deserving of analysis and discussion. As bold an attempt at commercial film-making as I can remember, Watchmen is an undeniably unique movie experience - rich, perverse, violent and resonant.\",\n",

Ukraine, Gaza etc etc. It's enough to make you lose faith in the human race - or it would be were it not for the occasional story of humanity at its best.In Czechoslovakia in 1938-9, a small group of people (Nicholas Winton is the best known as he was the last survivor of that group) are appalled by the plight of mainly Jewish refugees, and resolve to do something. Despite opposition from governments (German, Dutch, British and American) they manage to evacuate 669 children and provide them with foster families in the UK, where many of their descendants live to this day. A further 250 children were on a train that was scheduled to leave on the day war was declared. Two of them were still alive at the war's end.Then the story was forgotten for more than forty years, until at last Nicholas Winton was given the recognition he deserved (not the least astonishing part of the story is that Robert Maxwell did one decent thing in his life).The film is in two parts; the younger Winton being played by Johnny Flynn, the older by Anthony Hopkins. Both give stand-out performances. Also excellent is Helena Bonham Carter as Winton's mother. The scene where she tells a bureaucrat what she thinks of him is priceless.But the most important aspect of the film is its message. Human kindness is still a force in the world. Everyone can make a difference. No good deed, be it great or small, is ever wasted.If only governments were run by people like Nicholas Winton.\",\n",
       " \"Sound like a bold statement? Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception, but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core, this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed, as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (De Niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape, if you own the VHS version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully, as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others (who I am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that Heat drags in places, I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action. Come hungry.\",\n",

       " \"Goodfellas makes a strong case for itself as the most overrated movie of the 80s or any decade. Never in my life have I encountered a film less deserving of its critical and popular accolades. After watching it for the second time recently (to make sure my impression from a viewing years earlier was accurate), I feel every person involved in the picture, and particularly Martin Scorsese, deserves to be punished severely for inflicting Goodfellas upon me.Goodfellas has absolutely nothing to offer. It has neither the wisdom nor the compassion to say or reveal anything about life or human beings. Anyway, Goodfellas is not interested in that. It just wants to be smart, hip, and funny. With such lofty goals, it's a wonder this entire star-studded cast of actors and filmmakers fell so very, very short. Goodfellas is not smart. It is not intelligent enough to understand what it think it portrays on an individual or larger basis. It does not somehow explain or explore the mob psyche, the existence of organized crime in America, or anything else for that matter. Despite the fact that it is taken from actual events and people, it seems to desire no contact with reality.Goodfellas is not hip. Apparently Martin Scorsese was not aware that there is nothing less cool than trying hard to be cool. Goodfellas is full of flashy camera moves, tough looking guys in swank suits, and more fast, colloquial dialogue than you could beat out of Dashiell Hammett, but none of it adds up to anything but slime. Yes, that's right: slime. Goodfellas is so obnoxious you want to take a magical eraser and scrub each of its characters back into the pure white on the page from which they sprang. Is this an honorable aim for a film? To make you hate its characters, to make you hate its voice? Let me be the one to say that cynicism is generally a good cover for laziness, and as an approach to life it is one step above nihilism. Real cynicism has no place in art. Goodfellas is not funny. A complete lack of respect for human life is not a secret recipe for brilliant ironic comedy. It is disgusting, really, and those who laugh reserve a spot for themselves in the grime between the cracks under the bottom of the barrel of good humor.The performances in Goodfellas, much lauded, are ridiculously one-sided. How wonderful they managed to span the chasm between looking tough and looking smug - all except for Ray Liotta who has to do the balancing act between being paranoid and annoyed. Bravo.Of note is Scorsese's choice to play pop music over 95 percent of the film, presumably so that we have something to listen to while we are busy ignoring his movie.Goodfellas is trash. Utter trash. The only thing I took out of it is that it is unwise to let a gangster stand behind you.\",\n",

       " 'Luc Besson\\'s movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler.  Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package.  Jean Reno plays a character named  Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a \"cleaner\", or hit-man.  His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant.  Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role.  Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.Jean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about.  Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her.  Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope.  He moves the story along by his actions.  Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.The Professional is what movie-making is all about.  Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie.  Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates.  The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie.',\n",

I wasn't sure what to expect and actually planned on being a little disappointed with all the expectations and hype of such an all-star cast.From the moment the opening credits came up, the movie grabbed me by the neck, ripped me out of my seat and didn't let go until the final scene.Each performance is more masterful than the next. Damon was a tour de force as the lead, tapping every ounce of his acting reservoir for this role. Nicholson creates another classic role to add to his already sterling resume. His mob boss would almost steal every scene he was in, if it not for every other actor being so fantastic However, the biggest surprise for me personally came from Leonardo DeCaprio.Having never warmed up to any of his roles or movies, I found myself blown away by him in this. I'm not sure if it was the material he was given, or if DeCaprio has grown this much as an actor, or a combination of both, but he finally won me over with his role in this instant Scorsese classic. Every character is pitch perfect, every scene is right on the money. The plot builds to a crescendo of such dynamic proportions rarely seen on film. I don't want to give too much away, but I'm still shaken from the ride I was taken on.People go to the movies in the hopes that maybe once in a hundred times you get to experience storytelling so masterful and transcendent that it changes the way you view cinema. This is one of those spectacularly perfect times.Forget Taxi Driver. Forget Raging Bull. Forget Goodfellas.

It seemed like they condensed and rushed the storyline and as a result, it was just a poor production. Also, because it was rushed, I couldn't invest myself in any of the characters. I had no ability to care about any of them. If they had let the story take the path it should have, it probably would've been a lot more interesting. I have a hunch that there was a lot more to this story than what was displayed on the screen. It was a shame.\",\n",
       " 'http://switchingreels.com/2014/01/28/sundance-review-whiplash/Ever had a dream of being a great football player? A great dancer? A great singer? A great musician? Our protagonist has a dream of being a great drummer, a drummer that will be remembered forever. Maybe you are still fighting for your dream. Maybe you have given up on greatness. Greatness doesn\\'t come easily, you need to practice at it. Andrew practices until his hands bleed.Andrew (Miles Teller) is 19-year old student at a music conservatory in Manhattan. Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is a teacher at the conservatory with a ruthlessly brutal teaching style. After picking Andrew to play in the school band, he pushes Andrew to his limits in order to realize his full potential, at the risk of his humanity.I had a billiards teacher at one point in my life, who was close to becoming a pro in his craft but a grease fire accident changed all that. His perspective changed, to paraphrase, he realized he was becoming an asshole. He became a teacher of pool instead of becoming a pro player. Through him, I can understand what Terrence Fletcher was trying to instill into Andrew. My teacher would push me a little bit. When he gave me opportunities to show him up, \"run the table now,\" he would tell me, I failed. It\\'s embarrassing when that happens but it\\'s also a learning tool because more work needs to be done. You can\\'t get by on talent alone but it certainly helps. On the other side of it, I saw a little bit of my teacher in Andrew. Losing who you are to perfect something you love. Good thing my teacher realized before it was too late.I lost myself in the story. It had something to say about not settling and asking more of yourself. Two fantastic performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Perhaps it will push you to maybe pick up that guitar again, put on your ballet shoes, or hit the gym to bulk up. Whiplash is an incredibly powerful film. And after the final shot cuts to black, the film will stick with you for days.My expectations: Medium. I did not expect the film to be so powerful for me. Expectations exceeded.Recommendation: Cinema lovers and casual movie goers, I believe will enjoy this film.Re-watch value: I can watch this film again and I actually can\\'t wait until it hits distribution.Memorable: I am still thinking about this film.',\n",
       " 'The Big Lebowski is the type of movie that is so funny, and so clever, you want nothing more but to meet the Coen brothers, congratulate them personally for their unique talent, and get inside their heads and find out what makes these two geniuses \"tick\".  The main characters are Jeff Bridges (who plays such broad roles like The Muse, The Contender, and Sea Biscuit), John Goodman (who should have won an oscar for best supporting actor for his character, Walter Sobchak)Juliane Moore (Maude Lebowski)and Steve Buscemi (who is unique in every Coen Brother movie).The first time I saw this movie, I will admit that I enjoyed it, but did not fully appreciate its level of humor and raw talent.  I thought the middle section was a bit too depressing and long.  But trust me, this is a movie that gets more funny every time you see it, even if it\\'s your thousandth time seeing it. Its level of comedy, action, brutality, and vulgarity become that much more evident and important.The characters are brilliantly written by the coen brothers, and, likewise, are brilliantly portrayed by the actors.  The Big Lebowski is like no other film.  It will make you laugh and it will make you cry.  There is no other film such as TBL that is sharp and witty all the way through.

       " \"My favourite movie of all time. This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz's compound. And just like Willard, he DIDN'T know what he was going to do once he got there. This is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it offers no answers or conclusions. Consequently, because of this open-endedness, it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious. This movie defies categorization. Some call it a war movie which it isn't at all, really it is more of a personal study of man. The best pic about Vietnam is 'Platoon' in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers. Coppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review. The sheer audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic.It is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone. Very challenging to watch but rewarding as well. I could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless. This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification.A little footnote, definitely if your a first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now, watch the original version first, the 'Redux' version is, I think, more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a 'new and improved' version of the movie\",\n",
       " 'Ah, the Usual Suspects. My personal favorite movie of all time. Don\\'t let my bias be a fool. Perhaps it\\'s not THE best movie ever, but it\\'s one that I never get tired of.If you like flash and bikinis and breath-taking camera angles, you won\\'t find them here. Usual Suspects is not an \"epic,\" and it doesn\\'t pretend to be. It\\'s a modestly-budgeted piece by a fresh director (who later went on to do the X-Men movies, a FAR departure).A great, gritty script, beautifully-acted characters, and what many have called the greatest movie ending of all time, are some of the shining qualities that make the Usual Suspects an object worthy of praise above its humble-looking shell.The casting is very unusual but somehow fits perfectly. Gabriel Byrne is convincing as the ex-con trying to build a new life when he gets drawn back into his old life. Stephen Baldwin has the role of his career as the smart-mouthed and cocky professional. Kevin Pollak takes a big departure from his usual good comedy self to take a more dramatic role. Benicio del Toro literally takes a one-dimensional character with absolutely nothing in the script to give him character, and he fleshes it out with brilliant mannerisms and memorable mumbling to show incredible acting creativity. Kevin Spacey as we know him was born from this movie. His manners and fast-talking yet shy gimp nature are a treat to listen to throughout the flick.Without giving away the plot, the best and most genius parts of the movie are the subtleties. After you see the ending, and the truth hits you like a ton of bricks, you have to watch it again. On the second time through, you\\'ll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot a clue you missed the first time. It\\'s even possible to watch the movie multiple times and see something new with every viewing. It\\'s that attention to detail that make the deceptively innocent-looking Usual Suspects one of the greatest movies of all time.',\n",
       " \"Great action and fight choreography as was to be expected from a movie with this title, special effects regarding characters and their abilities were also very well done especially considering the budget constraints this movie had. Storyline was predictable from the beginning and the writing itself isn't gonna win any awards, characters say their catchphrases from the games in key moments of the film, however, one big surprise for me was the character of Kano. He was the biggest and funniest comic relief character in the whole movie, constantly throwing jokes and insults at other characters. Probably one of the funniest, self aware movie characters I've seen in a long time.There are also weird editing jumps in the movie, one moment you're looking at characters interacting and in the next you're looking at something completely different. The movie suffers from a few of these, but given this is the directors first foray into the world of movie making, I'll take that L, most of the other important things were handled with care,If you know what you're getting and your expectations are right, this movie isn't gonna let you down with violence and gore, if you're expecting more then it's gonna be a letdown.\",\n",

The running time of 1 hour 42 mins passed so quickly. Once again Netflix triumphs so well done to them.

It\\'s like that yappy drama society kid at college who is so consciously trying to act cool by breaking into song, dancing around chairs, drumming on desks and spitting jokey one-liners with a hand pistol flourish....the kind of person a cynical SOB like me just wants to punch in the throat.The central premise is about a young, good-at-heart kid forced into a life of crime in order to pay off a debt. The annoyingly slick, Abercrombie-faced \"Baby\" is not only the fastest getaway driver in Atlanta, we later find out he\\'s also a self-taught music producer, dancer and talented free-runner...are you rolling your eyes yet?The main mechanic, so lauded by critics, is that everything in the film revolves around music, from the editing to the dialogue. Since Baby is constantly plugged into his i-pod (so, we are told, to drown out tinnitus from a car accident which killed his parents), the film essentially plays like one giant music video, with nearly every gunshot, tire screech and sassy put down edited meticulously with the beats or riffs of whatever track is playing during the sequence.Unfortunately the songs didn\\'t make the hackneyed screenplay that much more interesting. While there are some splendid car chase sequences (too few in my book), one must endure cringey moments of Baby miming and dancing to James Brown, dull characters waxing poetic about song lyrics and saying cliché bull$hit like \"Sometimes all I want to do is head west on the 20 in a car I can\\'t afford with a plan I don\\'t have\". Everyone in the film is pretty, none of the gangsters really look like gangsters, least of all the Latina \\'Darling\\', who can\\'t even hold a gun convincingly and is just there to show cleavage and lick her lips at camera.Imagine the most indulgent ideas from Guy Ritchie and Tarantino\\'s trash bin channeled through a Justin Bieber video. Less style and even less substance.There are no doubt people who will love it for being a showy piece of nonsense, and there is some entertaining, high impact action, but it\\'s far from the genius some critics are praising it as.

Not just through the lens of said scope, but also the lens of childlike wonder.This is a heavy film that asks a lot of the audience. Anyone who sticks with it the whole way will be rewarded with a nice story of friendship and hope.

People will complain, will argue that I am wrong, but I will say it again...Braveheart is as close to perfection as a movie can be. The acting is superb, the man who played Lonshanks, the actor who portrayed Robert the Bruce, both should have been nominated for Oscars due to their powerful rendering of evil and a man who is saved from losing his humanity (from becoming evil) by meeting William Wallace. And let us not forget the direction, the cinematography. Braveheart is glorious, beautiful to look at. The slow motion pictures of horses preparing to charge armed combatants, the entire landscape of Scotland that Mel Gibson captures with the camera. Braveheart is artwork, it is as good as any picture. That the film is number 93 on the list of the top 250 movies ever is a shame. Yes there is violence in this film but that violence does serve a point...that freedom isn't free and sometimes it takes death, gruesome and horrible, to let ones people taste what it is like to be free. Braveheart is a great movie and it deserves to at least be in the top ten of IMDb's list of greatest films.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m not going to waste space with a synopsis, as every second or third review provides one. A good indication of a challenging and original film is the number of 1/10 and 10/10 reviews, where the 1/10 reviews consist of just a few lines.  A pretty sure sign that those folks weren\\'t able or willing to watch with an open mind.  Which is a good sign for casual viewers to give this film a wide berth.I wish everyone I care about would see Requiem for a Dream.  Not because they will like it, or that it will teach them something they did not already know, but that it\\'s a rare piece of work that will challenge and probably change them.  It\\'s a film that has never been made before, with nothing to compare to it - a rarity these days.  I often find myself recommending films to people that I am unable to briefly describe.  These are usually the most involving and affecting ones. I\\'d like my family to see this, but can\\'t *recommend* it to them.  I\\'ve recommended it to two friends, and they both had the same reaction:  I am glad I watched it, but I doubt I\\'ll be in the frame of mind to watch it again, knowing what you feel.As I sat watching the credits roll, I began crying, but I\\'m still not sure why.  Partly in reaction to the devastatingly tragic ending, partly the beauty (yes) of the film, partly my gratitude for good things in my life. I watched it again the same night with my girlfriend, not because I wanted to upset her, but I felt that I had to share it. After the credits rolled, we both were silent for a good ten minutes.  I found that I had thoughts I wanted to express, but could find no words.  This is one of the few films that are painful to experience, but I feel compelled to share with people I care about.  Some others in that short list include The Thin Red Line, Happiness, River\\'s Edge,and The Deer Hunter.These films all share a quality that\\'s difficult to name.  No one likes feeling disturbed or shattered by a film, a work of art, a piece of music, but I feel experiencing these emotions and being asked to think, not just be entertained, is important now and then.\"Favorite\" does not apply to this for me - this isn\\'t about entertainment.

       " \"I strongly urge anyone that considers themselves a fan of #Hellboy, the comics, the characters and not just the #GuillermodelToro/#RonPerlman films, please go see this film. This is a very different take on these iconic characters and the world they inhabit and it is the most fun version that I've seen so far. Don't get me wrong, I loved GDT's films, the man crafts beautiful modern fairly tales and this film was smart no to try and replicate that. Instead, this movie has more in common with #SamRaimi's #ArmyOfDarkness, over the top violence and Gore, not for those with a weak stomach, and frequent profanity. #DavidHarbour does an excellent job and plays the role very differently than Perlman did and it has the potential to propel him from TV into a full time movie star. #IanMcShane brings his usual gravitas and presence to the role previously embodied by the late great #JohnHurt, again being smart to not emulate that performance and make this role entirely his own.I feel like this movie is suffering from the same disconnect and out of touch effect that critics had with last year's #Venom. Critics almost universally panned that film while audiences similarly loved it. Every negative review I've read for this so far continually compares it unfavorably to the previous films and many also take issues with the excessive use of violence, Gore and adult language. What did you expect, this is an R Rated film and is thoroughly advertised as such.I hope positive word of mouth from fans makes this successful as they set up some very cool stuff for a potential sequel.If you love these characters like I do, if you love balls to the wall, over the top action horror, please see this film.\",\n",

It is a beautiful film with soul, wit, charm, style and love. It is simply outrageous! Bold and fantastic and fantastical. I am a straight man but my love for Ryan Gosling could change all that. He's a melancholy genius and Emma Stone is our muse. This film defies genre. It is a masterpiece. I urge you to see it. I was lucky enough to see it at the BFI London Film Festvial.

       " 'NOTE: This review is the fair and unbiased opinion of someone with extremely little knowledge of the Twilight series. I watched the movie with a few die hard fans who I talked to after the movie, and I will work some of their thoughts into the review.Another much loved book series has been brought to life in the form of Twilight, which despite having nothing in common with the Harry Potter series, will undoubtedly draw comparisons because of the furor and craze surrounding it. The main difference between the two, however, is that the Harry Potter films are generally good and solid films. Twilight, despite having done a couple things right, is not.As a story, I will admit, Twilight is very catchy and interesting. Now I see what all the hype is about. If I was a young girl, I would go nuts over this stuff too. It\\'s not just a vampire and a human falling in love with each other, but because of the two leads, it\\'s one of the best on screen romances of the decade. This, however, is severely hurt by the fact that Twilight boasts easily some of the worst writing and editing I\\'ve ever seen. Let\\'s not forget about the horrid VFX and pasty makeup, either. It\\'s one of the cheesiest films of the year, and can definitely be put in the category of \"so bad it\\'s ALMOST good\". Yes, I just invented that category.The \\'allure\\' of the film appears to be the character played by Robert Pattinson, who ironically was previously known for his role in the Harry Potter series. Pattinson succeeded there and he more than succeeds again, as he more than fit the bill for what he needed to do with the character. Most actors would believe the only requirement of the character is to be good looking, but Pattinson takes it a step further and makes Edward Cullen very likable, trustworthy, and in the end, a good hero for the audience. Kristen Stewart is sort of the queen of not showing facial expressions, so she\\'s perfect for the role of the awkward teen Bella Swann. However, there were sometimes where her lack of emotion bothered me.Our supporting players...Well, none of them are noteworthy like Pattinson is. The villain of the film is lame, cheesy, and played by an actor I can\\'t take seriously. Nikki Reed is probably the best as Rosalie, Edward\\'s \\'sister\\', and the antagonistic vibe felt from her adds a different side to the movie.Okay, I don\\'t really know what possessed the writer of this screenplay to make it so horrible (was it the source material?), because the dialog is just so bad that I laughed at serious moments. There\\'s a lot of intentional humor, mostly in the beginning when Bella and Edward feel like awkward teens in love. I guess the movie moved along okay, because I wasn\\'t bored at all. I was either laughing at how stupid the dialog was, laughing at some of the mildly funny jokes, or getting pulled in by the electric chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson.That, folks, is the reason most people will be able to sit through this movie. The chemistry between the two leads, romantically and sexually, is amazing. In this respect, Pattinson and Stewart are perfectly cast and it makes me wonder if they could end up together in real life some day. I was very surprised by how much I liked seeing their one on one scenes, as cheesy and bad as the VFX and editing are.As far as these visual effects go, I\\'ve seen a few vampire movies in my day. I\\'m going to assume director Catherine Hardwicke has seen a few. Well, she needs to watch a few more. Her fight scenes are horribly choreographed, terribly shot, and lack the intensity required to successfully rouse her audience. I could almost notice the wires the actors flew across on. I noticed a ton of errors with the editing as well, such as basic stuff like mouths moving and no words coming out, and words coming out when no mouths were moving. The fight scene at the end has wicked bad editing too, as the sound mixing also suffers as well.All in all, with Twilight, as bad a movie as it may be, I couldn\\'t help but stay interested in it because of the electric chemistry between the leads. That alone kept me in the seat the whole time. It is technically one of the worst films of the year, but the entertainment factor in the above respect keeps it out of the company of movies like Disaster Movie and College. I was actually lucky to see it with some of the fans of the book, and all of them (5) described the movie as a \\'disappointment\\' and that the film went \\'half way\\' with some subplots, either starting and dropping them, or randomly starting them halfway through an individual subplot. They were not happy at all with this movie, but agreed on one thing: Robert Pattinson was the perfect Edward Cullen. I\\'ll agree with them on all those points and say that Twilight is exactly what I thought it would be: so bad it\\'s ALMOST good.',\n",
       " 'There are certain films that get under your skin, never to come out. They change your life, subtly altering your perceptions of reality, almost always for the better.Dead Poets Society is one of those few films.I saw the movie back when I was in High School. I had a teacher who told us that we really needed to watch it; in fact, it was our \"homework\" for the day. We didn\\'t need to bring back a report, or talk about it in class. All he asked from us was to watch it, make up our own mind about it, and that was it. As you can imagine, many friends of mine didn\\'t watch it at all; I did. And yes, I feel I changed a bit from there on.Back when you are young, you never really stop to think what in the world you are doing with your life. You simply live for the day, hope your grades will be enough to pass, and that\\'s it. Long term thinking involves maybe flirting with a girl. Nothing more. What this film showed me was that we have the responsability and the joy of being alive in this planet. That we are dust, and we will go back to it, so we have precious little time to make a difference. That we have a moral obligation to \"seize the day, and make our lives extraordinary\" (my favorite quote in all movie history). That the world, basically is ours. That the only limitations are within ourselves, and that we owe it to us to fight, to rebel against conformity, to change what we hate and keep what we love. That living in this world is a beautiful responsability, and that only cowards dare not to change it for the better.The fact that the cast was basically my age, and was passing through the same dilemmas and situations I was facing made it all so much more powerful.So here I sit, 12 years from that day. I still don\\'t think I have seized the day completely. But I keep on trying; I always will. I wonder how many people were transformed by this gem of a movie; I hope many.10 out of 10.

He was more right than I ever could have known.The plot is stupid and is full of moments where my friends and I looked at each other and said \"wait, what?\". There are sequences in this movie that simply do not need to exist and provide literally nothing to the story. The technology, previously something I always thought was neat about Star Wars, is genuinely dumb and makes zero sense (why do big laser bolts in space arc like artillery?). I am ashamed to have paid money for this and as a long-time Star Wars fan it hurts to see just how dead the franchise I love really is. All that said, the special effects look and sound great, and it was fun to see Mark Hamill acting again. Other than that this movie is a disgrace not just to the franchise but to anyone with a brain.

       " \"Lindsay Lohan plays a teen girl trying to get along at a new high school. This time, she plays a girl home schooled in Africa, whose first experience at a public school is marred by a clique of nasty girls called the Plastics, who use gossip and other torture techniques to try to ruin her social life.The story makes it sound like another generic teen film but this one is actually quite funny and realistic. The most cynical person will point out that this is a cheap rip off of Heathers and they are similar. While Heathers is a good movie, mean Girls is an even better movie. I think Mean Girls is very good for a number of reasons. First, the script is actually creative and smart. Tina Fey seems to understand that teens want comedies they can relate to and she did that with Mean Girls. Of course, there were a few lame scenes but nothing that kills the film. Tina Fey should leave SNL and focus on her career in movies.Second, the acting is very good and convincing. Rachel McAdams offers the best and funniest performance as Regina. Her character is very mean (hence the title) yet I found it so hard to actually hate her. She has this charm that sucks the audience in on her and its so hard to hate her. Lindsay Lohan also gives a good performance as Cady. Her best scenes are with Rachel. They have very good chemistry together. The other plastics are played by Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried. They also give good performances and the scenes that have all the plastics together are very entertaining. The rest of the supporting cast are pretty good and Tina Fey also has a small role as Cady's math teacher.Another reason why Mean Girls is so good is because it's actually funny for people over the age of 21. It's not just for teens but also for adults. Mark Waters is proving to be very good at directing harmless comedies like Freaky Friday and this one. He keeps the film short yet enormously entertaining. I really don't understand how someone could actually give this movie a one. I understand some people finding it over the top or stupid but it doesn't deserve a one. In the end, this smart and funny teen movie deserves to be seen. Rating 8/10\",\n",

But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel. Trust me this is a great film.\",\n",
       " \"This movie is a hot mess wrapped in a pretty package. It's like they threw a bunch of stuff at the wall, hoping something would stick, but ended up with a jumble of good, bad and stale bits that don't quite gel together.The screenplay is a roller coaster, but not the fun kind. You've got your moments of laughter, sure, but then you're plunged into scenes so ridiculous or dull you'll wonder if the script was written during a group brainstorm where no ideas were turned down, no matter how nonsensical.The whole vibe of the film feels like it's stuck in a time warp, clinging to an old-school approach that's more yawn-inducing than nostalgic. And, boy, could they have shaved off some runtime. It drags like a lecture that could've been an email.Vijay's shines in bits and pieces, but even his charm can't fully distract from the chaos.Mrunal is not really matching up with Vijay, and her performance feels as if she's stuck on repeat, recycling the same handful of expressions we've seen in her last few outings. The rest of the cast? They're just there, doing their thing, not making things worse but not adding much either.On the technical front, they've splurged. Cinematography, sets, costumes - all top-notch, making you wish the story and direction had received half that attention. Background score gives you headache and the songs make for a good time to check your phone or go for a snack.Honestly, unless you've been hyped up by all the marketing or feel the unbearable peer pressure from your mates who can't resist jumping on every movie bandwagon, give this one a miss. It's not worth the sit-through, unless you enjoy critiquing every aspect or need background noise while doing something actually interesting.\",\n",
       " \"Well, I'd heard a lot about this film before I bought it, but nothing I was told really prepared me for how different this film is from anything else I've seen. On first viewing, Gummo appears to be a collection of random events, but after watching it a few more times, it it becomes more obvious how each scene and character link together (although there are still a few that I am unsure of!!). The nearest analogy I can think of is of a music album. Each scene is like a song that can be enjoyed on its own, but when the album is listened to as a whole it becomes much more than just a collection of songs, all linked in their own way. Plus, like a great album, the more times you listen\\\\watch, the more you get out of it. People will criticise this film for having no plot and to start with I agreed, but if you work hard to understand the film then you will get much more reward and enjoyment then from most Hollywood blockbuster's. The beauty of Gummo really is that there are so many questions that you can and will watch it again and again and get something different every time. This film is reasonably short, but it is probably the only film I have seen where every scene has worked. I am a very difficult viewer to please, but every scene in this film kept me enthralled and I did not want to fast forward once, even in the times I have watched it since (about 15 times!!) A magnificent film, and a great directorial debut from a name to watch in the future - Harmony Korine.\",\n",

For reference when I bought my ticket the theater employee said that they had been told to warn people that this film was over the top making me think many people were walking out asking for refunds.2. If you decided to see this film do not go see it during prime time in a packed theater. See it during a weekday matinee.

       " \"The Strangers is a movie that delivers everything it promises it would. It scares you. Simple as that. Instead of relying on buckets of gore and an over-contrived premise, it keeps things simple and thats what makes it work. For an hour and a half, the viewer is subjected to a slowly mounting sense of dread that just keeps building without ever pulling back. The story never falls victim to the usual horror movie clichés, but at the same time , it doesn't make any ridiculous attempts to go against them. Perhaps the best thing that the movie has going for it is it's believability. There isn't really any thing to distract the viewer from buying into the premise wholeheartedly. Considering that this is the director's first ever movie, it's a feat that's even more impressive. This is the kind of movie you shouldn't watch at home alone in the dark.\",\n",
       " \"Ex Machina has a very fitting sense of false intimacy. This is done visually as many of the close-ups are seen through glass. No matter how close we get to the subject on-screen, there always seems to be at least one wall of glass between us and it or them. The film also makes a very distinct contrast between it's interior and exterior shots. Outside of the facility is breathtaking landscapes. It is big, beautiful, refreshing and vibrant. Inside seems like an endless futuristic maze of glass, mirrors, plastic, chrome and dim lights. It is clean, cold and claustrophobic. A perfect setting for the subject that is explored in this tight, tense sci-fi thriller.Ex Machina is the best science fiction film on artificial intelligence since Blade Runner. While Blade Runner is an action thriller that relies more on it's epic visuals to tell it's story, Ex Machina is a dialogue-driven psychological thriller that slowly works it's way under your skin. Thought-provoking and terrifyingly suspenseful, an induced state of paranoia may linger long after the end credits begin to roll.The less you know going into a film like this, the better your experience will be. Alex Garland has given us a modern science-fiction masterpiece. Performances from all three leads are flawless and every other aspect of the production, from the cinematography to the soundtrack, is perfectly suited for the story. Not only is Ex Machina an amazing achievement for a directorial debut, it's Alex Garland's best written work to-date.\",\n",
       " \"I went into this film with low expectations. Having never read any of James Dashner's books, I cannot tell with any certainty if the screenwriters were true to the novel, or if the book makes a better effort than the film to distinguish itself from the multitude of superior films it meekly attempts to imitate. What I know is that I left the theater laughing. And not in a good way.What should have been an exciting and visceral tale of survival and intrigue ended up stealing two hours of my life by conning me into thinking I would see something original. Instead of suspense and excitement, MAZE RUNNER laid out an entourage of familiar tropes, paper-thin characters, and contrived situations. The 'villainous' antagonist of the film was as one-dimensional and irrationally-plot serving as any character I've ever seen. The character was so silly and unbelievable I actually chuckled at him several times when the film begged me to be serious. The screenplay was a crash-course in heavy-handed exposition. It was jammed with stock lines: bland, insinuating lines that were supposed to put me on the edge of my seat but instead left me thinking, 'Okay, when are we going to get to the POINT of this movie?' We got to see the intimidating-jerk-who-doesn't-listen-to-reason character, the hardened-guy-who-will-later-be-reduced-to-a-weak-state-to-show-us how-shaken-up-the-best-of-us-can-get character, the arbitrary female (although, thankfully, fewer movies today are marginalizing women), the amnesiac/s, and the innocent-character-we-can-get-away-with-killing. The pacing of the film, if not the events, were completely predictable and the ending (which I came to the theater curious for in the first place) came off as stale and forced, like the rest of the ponderous placeholder scenes that served as a plot. If you've seen movies such as HUNGER GAMES, CABIN IN THE WOODS, or PANDORUM, you have already witnessed better characters, better reveals, and more assured examples of plot development.Hollywood has developed a very convenient formula to keep theaters full of impressionable teen audiences. We have an outsider who needs to find a part of the group to cling to. They meet a variety of similar sympathetic characters. They act impulsively, which is usually a good thing. They are almost always rebellious and independent by nature, but they need to avoid arousing the wrath of whatever all-powerful conglomerate is hell-bent on keeping them down. Until, of course, the time comes to overthrow them using the various talents that the group possesses. Along with a healthy dose of courage, resolve... and luck. Buckets of ludicrous, gratuitous, convenient, plot-serving luck.There is no reason that this film should have made the money it has. After six days, it has recouped its budget threefold. Every ticket you buy gives them more ammunition for a brain-numbing cookie-cutter sequel. I'm not saying the film is the worst I've ever seen. But for God's sake, we don't need any more movies like this. Here's to a better future.\",\n",

       " 'OK - if you\\'ve already seen the movie and hated it, my review won\\'t change your mind, so move along folks, move along, there\\'s nothing to see for you here, thanks.Now for you, dear film fan, who is about to watch \\'The Hateful Eight\\', but who is now slightly worried because of some very mixed critical reactions - for YOU I\\'m writing this 100% spoiler-free review.Judging from many comments here on IMDb and other forums, I gather that many long-time Tarantino fans apparently don\\'t like his newest film. I had feared such a reaction as soon as I had finished watching the movie. It\\'s obviously Tarantino\\'s least accessible effort yet, and there\\'s a number of reasons for that, not the least of which being that this is simply not the film most people expected (or felt they were promised). So if you haven\\'t seen it yet and you\\'re a bit doubtful because of the negative reviews, let me tell you: you\\'ll likely end up loving it - as I did - IF you prepare yourself juuuust a little. And because I really liked the movie, I would like to help you do that via a short list of recommendations. Ready? Here it goes:1. Don\\'t go watch \\'The Hateful Eight\\' expecting a \"classic\" Western. It might belong to the Western genre, but if all that talk about Ultra 70mm Panavision had you thinking of lush outdoor scenery, vast landscapes or anything resembling a Sergio Leone movie, you\\'ll end up disappointed. There are a few nice shots showing snowy mountains, but 95% (perhaps more) of the story unfolds indoors (in one single room) - which isn\\'t to say that the cinematography isn\\'t absolutely fantastic. In fact, it\\'s more than fantastic: it\\'s stunning and worthy of an Oscar.2. Don\\'t expect any exciting \"action\" scenes (for lack of a better word: I don\\'t mean the \\'Fast & Furious\\' kind of action scenes) every 10 minutes or so; in fact, don\\'t expect anything other to happen between the characters than dialog for a loooooong time. Unlike in Tarantino\\'s previous films where we got almost \"spoiled\" by unexpected over-the-top moments in nearly every scene (except maybe for \\'Jackie Brown\\' and \\'Deathprooof\\'), this film has a very, very slow build. But: that\\'s not to say it ISN\\'T exciting (or that nothing does happen) - it\\'s just that the excitement and tension result mainly from the dialog and the excellent performances by the cast (at least for roughly two thirds of the movie).3. Best approach this film as you would theater; for that\\'s what \\'The Hateful Eight\\' really is: a stage play disguised as a movie. A stage play of a \"Who-Done-It\" murder mystery with a touch of Agatha Christie. But then again, that\\'s also a disguise, for the murder mystery is just a ploy to cast a look at a torn society rife with racial tension after the civil war. Which, of course, again serves as an allegory for race relations in modern-day America and as the director\\'s angry commentary on how hateful that situation still is today, on all sides. Now that sounds awfully serious, but don\\'t worry; despite some hard-to-stomach ugliness and the highly political undercurrent, there is plenty of Tarantino\\'s trademark humor throughout the whole film.4. Don\\'t expect to find a likable character you can root for. There\\'s a reason for the film\\'s title, and unlike in all his previous films, there is not a single person in Tarantino\\'s latest movie you\\'ll feel any real sympathy for. All the main characters have committed despicable, hateful acts, and they\\'re all beyond redemption - but that doesn\\'t mean they\\'re not compelling to watch (especially given THIS cast: everyone is fantastic, but Jackson, Russell, Jason Leigh and Goggins are just a joy to watch).5. Don\\'t expect a complex plot. In my opinion, among Q.T\\'s films this is the one with the most straight forward and most simple plot to date, yet at the same time it\\'s arguably his most complex - and most ambitious - film.So, dear film fan, that\\'s it: adhere to these here 5 \"commandments\", and there\\'s a big chance you\\'ll end up loving Mr. Banana Chin\\'s latest oeuvre as much as I did (mind; you might love the film just as much without taking any of the above advice). I admit, it took me a while to get into this dialog-heavy stage play and would-be Western, but once I did, I never looked back (and I can hardly wait to watch it again). 9 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/',\n",
       " 'I got a chance to see a sneak preview, and it was better than expected. First, I have to say that I\\'ve never read the book. My friend who saw it with me read it, and she said that the movie was pretty faithful to the book. The movie stars Anne Hathaway, a writer who winds up applying for, and getting the second assistant position to the Editor-in-Chief of THE fashion magazine called \"Runway.\" Her boss is played by the always fantastic Meryl Streep. While she gets less screen time in the movie, her mean looks and bitchy attitude makes her character stick with you. Also, the movie does give you some soft moments to make her a little more sympathetic than she was portrayed in the novel (or so my friend told me). I do wonder whether or not this movie would\\'ve worked if Meryl\\'s character was male instead of female. I won\\'t bore you with the other plot details because it was actually fun to not know how it unravels. Without the novel to go by, it was fun to figure out what bad thing was going to happen to her next. I do have to say that the movie has achieved the balance of being cute but not corny. You also get to understand why she just takes it all instead of just quitting to begin with. It\\'s funny enough to make you laugh out loud, but more importantly, it\\'s a great film to escape to.

       " \"I only had one thought on my mind for this Christmas: see Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino's latest opus, a Western set two years before the Civil War, concerns a former slave named Django (Jamie Foxx). He is freed by bounty hunter Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) in order to help him with a bounty. Quite quickly, Shultz takes Django under his wing and trains him as his partner. But he made him a promise: that he would rescue his wife from a plantation owned by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). And rescuing her is not going to be all that easy.What pains me the most about Django Unchained, as a die-hard Tarantino fan, is just how sloppy it all seems. I enjoyed every minute of it, but I could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels. Portions of the film feel episodic (the search for the Brittle Brothers, mentioned heavily in the trailers, begins and ends practically within minutes), and some scenes just seem to play out just for the fun of it. Another scene from the trailers involving a lynch mob with bags covering their faces seems added for comedic purposes, and has no real point of actually existing. More than any of his films before it, Django feels like Tarantino simply making a movie for sheer pleasure and with no outside motivations or controllers. The film threatens to go totally off the rails at any given moment, and lacks any real sense of direction or focus. It may sound ridiculous, but the loss of editor Sally Menke confirms a sneaking suspicion I always had about Tarantino – he needed a steady right hand to help encourage him as to what was needed and what was not. I do not want to criticize Django's editor Fred Raskin, but it is obvious he is no Menke and that works against the film heavily. It lacks the polish we have come to expect, and is practically stripped of the glossy/cool texture so prevalent in Tarantino's work up until now.But then maybe that was his intention all along, and perhaps Tarantino is airing out his frustrations with life and film in general. Django is deliberately shot on film (or at least from the print I saw), and looks very gritty and messy at all times. It is significantly more brutally violent than anything he has worked on before (the borderline cartoonish Kill Bill included), and has a very go for broke attitude about itself. The film seems to revel in how brilliantly it can splatter all the blood and gore (done through the use of squibs and no digital!), and how uncomfortably numbing it can make the violence. I know he does not care what people think of his films, but this movie especially seems like an emphatically raised middle finger to the establishment. And for all of my complaints about how messy it all feels, I was never once bored or felt like the movie was dragging itself out. The staggering 165-minute running time shockingly flies by faster than you might ever imagine.Acting wise, Tarantino stacks the deck with a number of recognizable character actors young and old for roles that vary in size. Most have very few lines, if any at all, and seem to just stand by, just as content as the audience is to watch the action unfold. It is a little off-putting, especially with how important some of these characters are initially made out to be. Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft (one of the most subtle references he's ever dropped) does well as the helpless victim and frequent dreamlike object – but she never really gets to show off any of her acting prowess outside of her facial reactions. They are increasingly effective, especially during horrific flashback scenes. But her work here feels ridiculously stunted in comparison to the other leads. Samuel L. Jackson, much like Tarantino himself, seems to just be having fun in his role as Candie's adviser Stephen. He plays on every ridiculous stereotype he ever has been associated with and then amps it up to a near ludicrous state. He is frequently hilarious, but the role seems to border on parody more than anything else.Surprisingly, Foxx takes a very long time settling into the leading role. It may just be the character, but it is quite clear from the on- set that he is not very comfortable in Django's shoes, and leads credence to why Will Smith, amongst so many others, dropped out of the picture so quickly. But once he finds his footing, he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. It is not an easy character to play, but Foxx makes it his own, bringing a sense of style and grace that are virtually absent from the rest of the film. And of course, he gets all the best lines.Waltz and DiCaprio are the clear standouts however, nailing every nuance of their sadly underwritten characters. While Waltz plays the straight man, DiCaprio is delightfully unhinged and vicious. Both are playing directly against type, yet are strangely comfortable in the roles. Watching them act circles around the rest of the cast, Foxx included, is the true highlight of the film. I just wish they were both given additional emphasis and more to do. For all of its numerous faults, I had a blast watching Django Unchained. It is hilarious, it is a lot of fun, and is wildly enjoyable. I genuinely think it could have been a lot better if there was more focus and direction, but this is very clearly a picture Tarantino wanted to make on his own terms. And for that, I applaud him for the effort. It is not his best work, but certainly not his worst. 8/10.\",\n",

       " \"When thinking about war films, it's very hard not to go straight to the classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan. You have to make something very special to be mentioned in the same sentence as films like those and in Hacksaw Ridge, I think Mel Gibson has made one of the all time great war films.Some war films use a particular war from history to tell a fictional story, all three of the above for example however, a war film for me becomes something else entirely when it tells a true story, especially one as remarkable as the story that Hacksaw Ridge is based on.Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) became the first Conscientious Objector in American history to be awarded the Medal of Honour even though he refused to kill or even carry a rifle while serving as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. Doss' phenomenal story of courage saw him single-handedly save the lives of over 75 of his comrades while under constant enemy fire.Hacksaw Ridge is very much a film of two halves; the first introducing us to Doss, exploring both his personal life and his motivations for choosing to become a Conscientious Objector and serve as a medic, the second depicting the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge, the site of one of the bravest human feats in history. Both tell the story of the determined individual that Doss was and Mel Gibson does a wonderful job in directing the film.Gibson has attracted a lot of bad press over the years but there is no denying that he is a good director, and in Hacksaw Ridge, he may just have made his best film yet. It's the emotional power of the story that Gibson taps into so successfully that makes Hacksaw Ridge such compelling viewing, whether it be Doss' arduous journey through combat training or the visceral war sequences. I was an emotional wreck as the credits started to roll.Speaking of war sequences, Hacksaw Ridge possesses some of the most brutal and harrowing you'll ever see, reminiscent of the opening to Saving Private Ryan. Due to the fact that Doss served as a medic, there are parts where a strong stomach is needed as he obviously has to tend to a number of seriously wounded soldiers. The relentlessness of the sequences is admirable from Gibson and they're wonderfully shot by Simon Duggan.Coming to the performances, Hacksaw Ridge features an amazing lead performance from Andrew Garfield, who wanted to move away from his days as Spider-Man with a chance to play such an inspiring real life hero. I thought Garfield was always one of the best things about the Amazing Spider-Man films but it's great to see him really grow as an actor. His performance as Doss is one of the best of the year and I would love to see him get some form of recognition come awards season.The supporting cast threw me a little but they all play their part in excelling the film, expected from the likes of Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer but the film surprised me with how good some of the cast were. Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey were two that come to mind but the real surprise was Vince Vaughn, who I never thought I'd see play a part in a war film, particularly that of an Army Sergeant.Few films this year have hit me emotionally as Hacksaw Ridge did and that's why I have to say it's a most welcome return to filmmaking from Mel Gibson. It's right up there as one of the best films of the year and definitely one to see on the big screen.\",\n",
       " \"Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)\",\n",

If those two can't chew up the scenery, nobody can. And, finally, Keira Knightly is a jewel.

       " \"My main takeaway when I left the theater this evening after watching this film, was that it was far too long and had probably one storyline too many to make this movie fly, but instead after the first act, it drags, and drags, and drags.The funny thing is, the best moments of this film are within the first hour. The less cohesive and more chaotic the film was, the more exciting it felt. After that point though, the film falls apart, the plotlines stray and the film has maybe 50% of the crazy energy that the first third had. It attempts to try and regain that energy in the finale, but doesn't quite capture what came before it. It turns from debauchery to horror, and it didn't gel well for me. Felt like the tone contradicted itself from where it began.The acting on the other hand is fantastic. Robbie and Pitt are electric, and the way Diego Calva can emote without saying anything is brilliant. I just wished the script and direction from La La Land writer/director Damien Chazelle was as good as the acting. Sometimes, the film felt like I was watching four films at the same time. Each of these plotlines could have had their own movies and seeing them all jumbled together here felt self indulgent and exhausting by the end of it. Only one of the storylines have any sort of ending that makes it feel justified in it's telling. Afterward, when the credits start to roll, you're just sat there with no feeling for what you just witnessed for a little over three hours.Overall, I only recommend for people who don't mind the three hour runtime, but keep in mind that the films plot goes absolutely nowhere, and although it might be a fun trip at times, it is a rather pointless one.2 talking pictures out of 5.\",\n",

       " 'Like fellow 2009 superhero release Watchmen, Wolverine is that rare comic book film which almost appears inevitably more likely to please audiences that are not fans of the source material. However, unlike Watchmen, which adhered so closely to its source material that a falling short by comparison proved inescapable, Wolverine\\'s inevitable backlash of fan outrage stems from its flagrant disregard for its source material. The film casually mutilates and re-writes the comic book context of its source material with the cold disdain of its protagonist, hacking one of the most genuinely compelling, subversive and horrifying superhero back-stories into the worst kind of safe, familiar, PG rated commercial dross. All of Wolverine\\'s compelling comic book edginess is distilled into a flaccid script which forgoes exhilaration for only occasionally impressive fight/chase/explosion scenes, complexity for eye-rolling cheese and broad humour, and story cohesion for an attempt to cram in far too much subject matter and avoid the true dramatic meat of the story. While further focus on the Wolverine/Sabertooth dichotomy could have yielded a narrative volumes stronger, the film continually broadens its scope, seemingly attempting to bank on the in-jokey winks to fans of the comics by hinting at broadening the Marvel universe in further sequels demonstrated in 2008\\'s Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk. But while their fan nods were tasteful and enjoyable, Wolverine\\'s attempts at matching them appear to be building up to an almost sinister bid for Fox\\'s superhero franchises to compete. Recognizable X-Men characters are continually shoehorned into minuscule parts (fans of Deadpool, Blob, Gambit or, *groan*, Cyclops don\\'t go in expecting much but disappointment) for seemingly the sole purpose of leapfrogging off Wolverine\\'s story into their own spin-offs. However, such an overflowing mass of secondary characters only serves the dual purpose of both derailing Wolverine\\'s story and not even serving to satisfy comic fans clamouring to see their favourite characters on screen, as the fleeting, shallow depictions hardly prove satisfying character development by any stretch of the imagination. If the filmmakers choose to tackle established characters to appease fan expectations, doing nothing with the characters (let alone doing them far from \\'properly\\') hardly seems a suitable way to satisfy a demanding audience. Director Gavin Hood (known for excellent African drama Tsotsi of all things) has been vocal about his clashes with the studio over the film, and one can only assume, given his excellent credentials, that most of his proposed changes would have been for the better. As it is, Hood demonstrates a shaky directorial presence at best, masking his action scenes in whirling cameras making it near impossible to see, and complimenting most tense or dramatic scenes with a cascade of Harry Gregson-Williams\\' tiresomely banal and clichéd musical score. That is not to say the film is entirely devoid of quality, but it is reduced to occasional fleeting moments (sporatic bursts of creativity during fight scenes, a promising African raid plot point, and an undeniably gripping if under-explored sequence of Wolverine going through the Weapon X program). But, like the irritatingly freeze-frame beset but otherwise clever opening montage (showcasing Wolverine\\'s progression through numerous world wars) such quality is often overshadowed by cringe-worthy prevailing flaws making it all the more difficult to appreciate. Ironically for the film situating him most justifiably in the lead role, Hugh Jackman gives his weakest performance in his foundational role as Wolverine. While Jackman\\'s natural charisma and steely credibility still make him a far more sturdy enough lead than his film deserved, his under-exploring of Wolverine\\'s feral ferocity and darkness still leaves an ultimately unsatisfying taste in the mouth. Despite initial skepticism of miscasting, Liev Schreiber proves far more resonant as Wolverine\\'s animalistic adversary Sabretooth, providing a savagely threatening yet controlled performance, which, despite falling short of the true animalistic frenzy Sabretooth should have been, proves one of the more successful attributes of the film. Similarly, Danny Huston provides a welcome dash of class as Machiavellian military official William Stryker, managing to overcome the shortcomings of an underwritten character with an impressively realized, wonderful presence. Ryan Reynolds also proves perfectly cast as twisted mercenary Deadpool, thankfully managing to suppress star showiness in favour of suitably manic humour - nonetheless, Reynolds is criminally wasted in a far too brief and insultingly warped butchering of his comics incarnation. Taylor Kitsch, conversely, gives a bland, dopily flat take on fan favourite Gambit, the character\\'s legendary suave charisma as nonexistent as Kitsch\\'s Cajun accent, doing little to justify his character\\'s near pointless addition. While it may function suitably as mindless summer entertainment, the inherent complexity in Wolverine\\'s backstory makes its reduction to such a near outright insult to fans of the comic source material. If left as a standalone film, Wolverine might have been dismissible as a mostly harmless disappointment, but with such blatant spin off begging, it evolves into something far more objectionable. While the film has its moments, as a cohesive unit it can be considered nothing less than a tragic waste of potential, floundering any inherent quality in gaping plot holes and unnecessary obvious comedy or \"tearjerking\" scenes. Wolverine\\'s adage of him being \"the best I am at what I do\" could hardly be farther than the truth when applied to his film. -4/10',\n",
       " \"John Wick is something special. It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.\",\n",

       " \"Perhaps I'm a little biased. After all, this is set in the city I live and work in, and seeing Oxford Street and Piccadilly Circus, which I pass by every morning and which are usually teeming with crowds of people, completely empty was enough to send shivers down my spine. Usually when you watch a movie like this it's located in some nondescript Midwestern village, which makes it easy to detach yourself from the events unfolding on screen. But seeing them occur in the place you call home is something that gives it an entirely new sense of reality, and one I was previously unaccustomed to.Still, judging 28 Days Later entirely on its merit as a film, it's easy to arrive at the conclusion that it's a fantastic achievement, as well as a coming-of-age of sorts for director Danny Boyle; I can't say the MTV-inspired vanity of The Beach, or the self-consciously trendy posturing of Trainspotting appealed to me, and to my shame I initially expected 28 Days Later to be given a similar treatment. Thankfully, my fears proved unfounded, discarded straight after a opening sequence which is at once effortless and fearsome. The rest of the movie was a joy. A terrifying joy, but a joy nonetheless.It's true that sometimes minimalism can be more effective than overblown bravado, and it's definitely true for this movie. It's the scenes of complete silence which get to you the most; an entire metropolis empty. The grainy picture serves to add a documentary-style quality to the film, which makes the whole situation seem almost too real to bear. Definitely a wise choice to film this on digital video.You will occasionally meet people who thought 28 Days Later wasn't 'scary' or 'gory' enough. These are the same people who will tell you that 2001 was 'boring', or that Memento was 'confusing'. Ignore them. Others didn't understand the purpose of the second half, or were confused by its change of pace, feeling that it distracted from the movie as a whole. However, I personally regard the second half as very important because, as another reviewer pointed out, it makes a very succinct point: What is scarier, the end of the world, or having the world repopulated by maniacs? That, I think, is where the real Horror of 28 Days Later lies.28 Days Later, like the Romero zombie flicks of yore, is ultimately an allegory of the days we are living in, an age in which we are constantly confronted with violence by the media (much like the ape right at the start of the film), where violence begets violence, and humanity faces an uncertain future. I applaud Danny Boyle's bravery in making 28 Days Later because he undoubtedly took a big commercial risk when the majority of the cinema-going public might prefer escapism to words of caution. Remember, Rage is a human-made disease. Quite the allegory there.Like most great masterpieces of their time, 28 Days Later has been misunderstood by a considerable amount of people. I have no doubt it will go down in history as a classic, the one movie which perfectly sums up the confused era we are living in. And even if you didn't like it, it would be advisable to give 28 Days Later another chance; it's a haunting experience when looked at from the right angle. Danny Boyle has many years left in him, I hope he'll continue making more movies like this.\",\n",
       " 'I am nearly fifty years old. A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still, these are after all just children\\'s movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can\\'t take such movies too seriously, can one?And so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney \"adventure\" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect?And then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...I cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen \"Pirates\" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It\\'s like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, \"Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don\\'t you?\"And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn\\'t Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?I am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb?I often don\\'t even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins.Except for this year.Go Jack.And, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge-podge of loosely- connected \"money shots\" this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-heartedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, \"You\\'d best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you\\'re in one!\" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt\\'s pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck-swabbing. And then there\\'s the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey.And now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking \"overproduced by\" credit on the cover-liner. \"Bombastic.\" \"Overdone.\" \"Absurdly Stupendous.\"Well, perhaps it is, for those who spend their lives evaluating such things. To me, it is absolutely transporting. I first listened to it while doing a work-out on a rowing machine and found that I tripled my usual distance. It was like mainlining some hazardous tachycardic amphetamine.Once again, the children were wondering, \"What\\'s up with Daddy? Is he OK?\"Perhaps I am just losing my grip, having an adolescent movie get to me this way. But when those final credits roll, and Captain Jack narrows his eyes and says, \"Now, bring me that horizon. Drink up me hearties, yo ho\" and the music swells ... it is difficult to put into words the effect it has.At this point my children have to yank me forcibly from the theater, lest I persist in watching the credits to the bitter end, and bid good-bye to the little monkey once more, wiping tears of exultation from my eyes.This is not just another \"entry\" in the summer blockbust sweepstakes. It is an exquisite work of fantasy and inventiveness, a true classic, on the order of \"The Wizard of Oz.\" I do hope Depp\\'s performance garners not just awards, but a place in the pantheon, something we old fogies -- and our gently fogeying children decades hence -- will show to our children and grandchildren like a revealed treasure. I cannot recall any movie having such an effect on me.',\n",

But again, that\\'s personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it\\'s PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering \"Can I take my kid to see this?\". Well, that\\'s down to you. The film isn\\'t overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The \"twist\" at the end, and yes there\\'s a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don\\'t know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you\\'re even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn\\'t call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I\\'d honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones.

It\\'s not \"balls-to-the-wall\" scary and I honestly don\\'t think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be.

Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch. The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.At a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive.

Speaking of the direction, it is fine but I think there was potential to really get creative and design some thrilling set pieces.

       " '\"X-Men\" is a rare treat-- a blockbuster that lives up to its hype and a comic book adaptation that hits the mark.Along with Tim Burton\\'s \"Batman\", this stands head and shoulders above all other superhero movies.  It\\'s a genre that\\'s usually synonymous with silly, campy, cartoonish crap, but Bryan Singer delivers a long-awaited exception to the rule.  \"X-Men\" is smart, stylish, and very cool... one of the better sci fi/fantasy films of the last decade.Of course, it helps to have good source material.The X-Men comics, which originated in the 1960s, are more politically progressive and morally complex than older superhero stories such as \"Superman\" where the heroes are always right, and truth, justice, and the American Way always prevail.  The series is a well-crafted parable about individuality and discrimination.  The characters are mutants--struggling to find a place in a society that rejects them.  Its primary villain, Magneto, isn\\'t an evil lunatic-- he\\'s a sympathetic character, a misguided revolutionary playing Huey Newton to Professor Xavier\\'s Martin Luther King. The iconic character, Wolverine, is a beer-swilling anti-hero who cares little for ideals and fights only to protect himself and his loved ones. The female characters are as powerful and important as the men, rather than being mere love interests.Rather than making just another flashy explosion-per-minute-special-effects-extravaganza, Singer practices the lost arts of character and plot development.  As a result, the movie has a far greater depth than the average big budget summer flick.  The acting is also quite good on the whole.  Hugh Jackman, who plays Wolverine, is fantastic--a bona fide Clint Eastwood caliber badass.  Some of the dialogue is fairly cheesy, but in the hands of Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart it sounds quite convincing.  (Stewart has made a career out of making lame dialogue sound cool.)Hard-core fans of the comics have complained about the omission of several popular X-Men.  This is silly.   A movie that gave the background on every character in the comic books would be 6 hours long.  There will be plenty of time to develop new characters in the forthcoming sequels.  Fans have also complained about the casting of Anna Paquin as Rogue.   I disagree.  Rogue is unable to touch another human being without harming them--she would not realistically act like a confident, sassy warrior.  Paquin did a tremendous job of conveying the fear and isolation that such a young woman would feel. She will undoubtedly grow into the part in future movies.In the end, \"X-Men\" is a comic book movie.  Superpowers are explained with silly pseudoscientific babble, the plot revolves around a fairly ridiculous take-over-the-world scheme, and names like \"Magneto\" are spoken with a straight face.  Don\\'t read all the glowing reviews and expect Citizen Kane. But don\\'t underestimate \"X-Men\" either.  It is an intelligent movie that people will enjoy whether or not they are familiar with the comic.',\n",
       " \"Call Me By Your Name is the kind of movie that makes you sit through the credits with tears rolling down your face, staring blankly at the screen with a lump in your throat and tightness in your chest. Call Me By Your Name is not a tragic movie. It's not a sad movie. It's not a pretentious movie. It's a movie about love, and love, and love. A beautiful love that will leave you longing to find your own love and drown in it. Timothée Chalamet is an absolute force of nature. Elio will make you want to love, and hurt, and piece yourself back together with absolutely no regrets whatsoever. Elio will make you want to live your life to the fullest. Elio will make you want to break your own damn heart. It's so rare that a performance truly shows the depth of longing, and despair, and passion a character conveys through written words without the internal monologue. Timothée is truly a revelation and his last scene during the credits will have a lasting impact on everyone.Armie Hammer is absolutely brilliant in the way he humanizes Oliver who is somewhat glorified through Elio's lens in the first part of the book. In the movie, Oliver is endearing and human and sexy and caring. He cares for Elio, and his love for him is so tender and so touchingMichael Stuhlbarg's monologue delivered nearing the end of the film is a complete masterpiece, and without a doubt that monologue with be taught and quoted for many years to come. A raw and beautiful scene.Watch this movie. Watch it, and love it, and don't let it fall victim to over-hype. Watch this movie. Fall in love in two hours and twelve minutes, then question every single time you didn't allow yourself to feel just because you were afraid of getting hurt. Was avoiding a possible heartbreak that might have shattered you worth never getting a taste of the heavens? Was killing the potential pain and heartache worth it? Was it worth it?\",\n",
       " 'I read through many of the reviews for this 2019 version of \"Little Women\" and noticed that most reviewers adored the film. Because of this, I assumed I also would love the movie. Sadly, however, I was left feeling ambivalent about it...and I noticed that my wife and oldest daughter felt pretty much the same way.I won\\'t talk about the plot...after all, there\\'s a summary on IMDB and lots of reviews talk about this. What I should mention is that the film is much more like the book than previous versions....a plus. But the reasons I still did not love this film are what stop me from recommending the film. First, there simply is too much story to cram into a little over two hours. If you are going to try to stick closer to the book, then perhaps consider making it a mini-series. This is because although the film is more like the book, to do this they also omit a lot of things....making the story seem a bit disjoint and confusing. Second, I really didn\\'t think they did a good job of helping the viewers to actually care about the characters. Some of this was because the little women in the story were poorly chosen--much too old in some cases (the 12 year-old early in the story looked to be about 20). Some was because the choppiness of the story really harmed the film because the characters just seemed one-dimensional. Overall, a decent story but even with its sticking closer to the book, I much preferred the 1990s version...which was much more charming, fun and likable.',\n",
       " 'SLOWburning detective movie and when I say SLOWburning then I mean really SLOW. Sorry for all these capital letters, but the first hour nothing much happens and I was wondering if anything was about to happen at all. Well, fortunately it did!The REAL suspense and thrill (only slowly yet steadily) intensifies during the second hour, which gets really creepy and intense, with a final that is like a sledgehammer. Wow. Really impressed by it.The good: Benicio del Toro Benicio del Toro Benicio del Toro.This man has got charisma few other actors (are lucky to) have. He really steals the show, with his very subtle acting skills, that convey so many different feelings that simply watching Benicio del Toro lifting up a small glass to drink is fascinating to watch.Benicio del Toro co-wrote the screenplay and he co-produced this movie as well. So he had a lot of cloud. And it shows, because this is one heck of a Benicio del Toro flick.The director made his feature movie debut, with only having made lots of music videos before and although I dont think his direction was terrific, it certainly was a masterful debut.Quite impressed AND spooked out by it. Recommended for the art house movie fans of slowburning (yet still suspenseful) detective movies.',\n",
       " 'Reading all these reviews about what a \"Masterpiece\" this movie is makes me wonder if I missed something or if I\\'m just stupid. If you\\'re someone who\\'s raving about how creative and revolutionary this movie is, you\\'re either just trying to fit in as a horror movie snob or saw a completely different movie. Seriously, I sat there through the first hour of the movie and wondered if I somehow walked into the wrong theater and was seeing a different movie. The pacing is incredibly slow, and I understand that the first half of a slow burning horror film like this one is supposed to build suspense, but unlike other horror flicks this film keeps you waiting and waiting and waiting for absolutely nothing. The only positive thing about this movie is the acting. The movie does have good performances from Gabriel Byrne and Toni Collette, although I don\\'t feel her acting is \"Oscar worthy\" like people are saying. It just makes me wonder how desperate these two great actors must have been for a paycheck. This movie was marketed as something that would make people rethink what horror movies are all about. In the end, there\\'s nothing to spoil about this movie because nothing happens. The plot develops extremely slowly as a poorly written family drama. Then in the last 20-30 minutes the director must have remembered that he was supposed to be making a horror movie and just slapped together an ending full of countless scary movie cliches that left everyone in the theater scratching their heads. Someone at my showing actually said out loud when the credits began to roll \"wtf was that movie\" and everyone laughed.I get that cinematography wise this movie is supposed to be brilliant, because it does look pretty good. But good visuals aren\\'t enough to save a boring movie with a poorly put together plot in my opinion. I\\'ve seen a few other reviewers on here mention how people in the audience were laughing out loud during the \"scary\" parts of this movie, and I can say that most of the theater I was in, including myself, was filled with people laughing and loudly cracking jokes at how cliche and confusing the ending of this movie is. DO NOT waste your money on this movie. Stay home. Spend time with your family. Read a book. Spend 2 hours of your life doing literally anything except for watching Hereditary.',\n",

Aside from the fact that the film is obviously celebrating blatant racism masked as anti-racist satire, the story wasn't good, the acting was (overall) subpar and even the special effects left to be desired.If you're looking for something good that will scratch this itch, rewatch the Harry Potter films. Take another turn with Lord of the Rings and then, of course, the Hobbit. Heck, even the Merlin show on BBC would be a solid choice. This film is part of the problem.\",\n",

Of course, it is a movie from a different era and if you don't like those type of movies then it won't be your thing. But if you give it a chance you may like it too just like I did.JD did very well.

       " 'What persuaded me to watch this movie was the blessing bestowed upon it by the stories original creator, Stephen King, who claimed: \"I wasn\\'t prepared for how good it really was\".He\\'s not wrong.\"IT\" is quite extraordinary. The attention to detail, the subtle but effective comedic undertone and the exquisite cinematography not only do the original title proud, they make this re-imagining of the original classic even better than its predecessor. It\\'s a very scary film but what impressed me was how true the film sticks to the original\\'s tricks; it isn\\'t filled with loud in-your-face jump scares, in fact, a lot of what makes this film scary is the slick cinematography and intricate shadow play. The use of lighting and creation of atmosphere is what makes this film so tense, which is why it\\'s perfectly suited for those who like Horror movies but without the obnoxious gore.Watched the pre-release as a critic - August 28th.',\n",
       " \"'The Dreamers' is Bernardo Bertolucci's bizarre and fascinating (if not altogether successful) distillation of the radical '60's mentality. Since the film is set in Paris in 1968, the radicalism naturally takes the form of perverted sexuality and extreme cinephilia. Leave it to the French to be exploring l'amour in all its myriad possibilities!In terms of plotting, 'The Dreamers' is much like an incestuous version of Truffaut's menage a trois classic 'Jules and Jim,' with the new film's subject matter as shocking today as was the earlier film's in its own time. Time and culture sure do march on, and it always seems to be the French leading the way. In 'The Dreamers,' Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel) are twins who have developed a rather 'unnatural' attraction to one another, becoming 'one' in virtually every way imaginable - physically, spiritually, psychically. Matthew (Michael Pitt, who looks for all the world like Leonardo Di Caprio) is the young American in Paris whom they pull into their strange little world of sexual intrigue and emotional games. Matthew is a product of his time, a young man who is not very experienced in the ways of the world but who is willing to partake in the moral relativism that is permeating the culture. Thus, he becomes the perfect candidate for Isabelle and Theo to work their magic on. Their power of attraction proves overwhelming and irresistible for Matthew, for they are both exotically beautiful creatures, seemingly in tune with the trendy radicalism swirling around them. Yet, Mathew eventually discovers that they are really only passive observers paying little but lip service to the cause, too obsessed with their own twisted relationship to actually step out and participate in those grand social movements they talk so freely about. Isabelle and Theo are 'radicals' to be sure, yet their radicalism seems to be channeled in a self-destructive, ultimately futile direction. Only over time does Matthew awaken to this realization.Due to the extremely sensitive nature of the subject matter, Bertolucci often seems more interested in shocking than enlightening us. Isabelle, Theo and Matthew are so insulated and cut off from the outside world that the points Bertolucci seemingly wants to make about the times - as reflected in protesters marching in the streets, the references to Vietnam, Mao and Jimmy Hendrix - feel tacked on and superfluous, not particularly integral to the film as a whole. He is never quite able to bring these background elements and the foreground story together in any meaningful way. What Bertolucci does capture well is the obsessive love the French have always had for the cinema as both entertainment and art form. His characters live, breathe and think films, often acting out favorite scenes while the director intercuts snippets from the movies themselves. The beautiful thing about the French is that they have always had such an eclectic taste in film, embracing both American studio and French New Wave products with equal passion. And this artistic open-mindedness Bertolucci captures with gleeful abandon. The film, in many ways, becomes an homage to Chaplin and Keaton, Astaire and Rogers, Samuel Fuller, Truffaut, Godard, Greta Garbo and many other icons of movie history.'The Dreamers' doesn't entirely hold together and the sum of its parts is better than the whole. Still, the acting is excellent and Bertolucci has lost none of his skills as a director, making each beautifully composed shot stand for something - a real treat for audiences bored to tears by the kind of by-the-numbers film-making we get so often today. Bertolucci is a true film artist and it is a joy just to sit and watch what he does with his actors and his camera, like a master painter working wonders with his canvas.As for the much-vaunted sexual content of the film (it is rated NC-17), certainly those who are easily offended by nudity and provocative sexual themes had best avoid subjecting themselves to this film. Those, however, with a more open mind will find little that is overtly offensive about what is shown here. In fact, if Isabelle and Theo weren't brother and sister, there would be little controversy at all generated by the film. My suspicion is that Bertolucci and writer Gilbert Adair made their film about incest because an ordinary love triangle would have seemed just too commonplace in this day and age to serve as a successful plot device for a film whose very theme centers around radicalism. They really needed to shake the audience up and this was as effective a way as any to do that. Whether it repels more people than it compels is something only time will tell.As it is, 'The Dreamers' is not an entirely successful film, but those impressed by fine film-making had best not pass it up.\",\n",
       " \"The word 'perfect' is very objective especially when it comes to film. While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.The film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. The performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.Overall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.\",\n",
       " \"When reviewing a movie featuring Diljit Dosanjh in a role where he doesn't wear a turban, it's essential to consider the cultural and religious significance of this decision for many in the Sikh community. The turban is not just a piece of headwear; it represents honor, dignity, and identity for Sikhs worldwide. It is a symbol of tradition and deep-rooted beliefs, and for many, seeing a prominent figure like Diljit without a turban can be unsettling. His influence extends beyond his artistic talent; he is a role model for millions of young Sikhs who admire his success and look to him as a representation of their culture.While actors often take on diverse roles and adapt their appearances for the sake of a character, there is a sense of disappointment when it comes to Diljit not wearing a turban in this movie. It feels like a missed opportunity to uphold the cultural heritage and values that the turban symbolizes. For those who hold the turban in high regard, this choice may overshadow the film's storyline and Diljit's performance, leading to a decision to forgo watching the movie altogether. The decision not to watch the movie is a reflection of the respect and reverence for the turban and the values it represents within the Sikh community.\",\n",
       " \"Sometimes you come across a movie that takes no risks. It's light on story, avoids character development, and focuses on getting to the next scene as easily as possible. Mario Bros. Doesn't have any inherent plot holes or issues, but it tends to leave you in a state of just being a viewer rather than participating in the movie. In the end, it's not bad per se, but comes off as flat and lifeless.The positives are all agreed upon by anyone who likes it, because the positives stand out by not being able to be compared against anything else. People have fun with the action. They love the Easter eggs. And the composed music is good. The action is done well, but without much dramatic weight, only carry the movie so far. Easter eggs don't nor should have any bearing on how good the ovoid is. The music was well incorporated, minus the pop songs that truly don't work.It's not good enough to play things easy, and rely on fans to spot visual Easter eggs, to call the movie good. It's average at best mostly because it was watchable and didn't have any outright flaws. It just didn't take chances that could've ended up becoming flaws. Even if you had a good time watching it, there's not enough value to see it again. If you're a fan, check it out. If not, you won't miss a thing by skipping it.\",\n",
       " 'This film is superb, in fact as Shakespeare once said \"Its the bees\\' knees\". The film captivates the audience from the beginning.  Each of the twelve jurors are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves. The characters are well draw out and individual, each with his own personality.The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start.  We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not.  We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case.  But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda\\'s character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters.  This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.How a film should be made.

       " \"Crazy, Stupid, Love. is one of, if not the best, American romantic comedies of the past decade. This may come as a shock to some (as it surely took me aback) but there is no other way to describe it. Going into an advanced screening of the film earlier this week, I had my doubts that it would be anything outside of generic. But instead of tripe, I got one of the most unexpected surprises I have seen all year.Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) have hit a rough patch in their long-time marriage, and Emily inadvertently announces to an entire restaurant that she wants a divorce. Down and depressed, Cal starts drinking away his sorrows at a local bar, attempting to make sense of his predicament with anyone who will listen. Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a professional bachelor, takes notice and makes it his personal mission to help Cal get over his wife, and become a new man in the process.But this is just the main plot thread of the movie. It also follows Jacob's relationship with the absolutely stunning Hannah (Emma Stone), throws in a bit of curveball with Emily being romanced by David (Kevin Bacon), and even has a bit of a focus on Cal's son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) pining over his older babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton). It may sound a little packed with threads and too many characters, but Crazy, Stupid, Love. is able to navigate between each character and couple with ease. It reminded me a lot of Valentine's Day, and how its main goal was to depict how different love is for a sizable amount of couples and singletons. Except it failed miserably at it, and stood out more as an example of every rom-com stereotype you could imagine. Thankfully, Crazy, Stupid, Love. takes the higher road and breathes new life into a stale genre.While the impeccable cast is more than enough reason why the film succeeds so well in being an atypical film in the genre, it is the crew behind-the-scenes that surprises even more. The film is written by Dan Fogelman, who is best known for a string of Disney films and the atrocious Fred Claus, and is directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who wrote and directed the sadly little seen I Love You Phillip Morris and wrote the now classic Bad Santa. These three would not be the first group on men I would turn to for a film like this, but their relative lack of expertise helps propel the film to the heights it reaches. It takes darkly hilarious turns in certain instances, plays other sequences totally unconventionally, play even more out with a foreboding sense of drama the trailer merely hints at, and trumps more than its share of genre stereotypes. Weaving between the plots lines, they make the film feel unique and different from others, all while giving it an aura of authenticity. While they stumble a bit in the final act with a series of sitcom-like shockers that border on ludicrous, they manage to pull off the rare feat of actually making the audience wonder if these characters will all end up together in the end, or if they will walk their separate ways; something that is truly uncommon for this genre.Acting wise, the film delivers in spades. Carell gives one of his best performances to date as Cal, moving as swiftly as the script requires between depression and humiliation, and touching and hilarious. The film stretches his dramatic muscle more than most, and allows him to give a performance that does not rely on laughs. The expressions on his face are just devastating in some sequences, and the wonder in other scenes is ridiculously hilarious. It is a performance I hope to see him come back to again, and make even better. Gosling plays against type, and gives an absolutely hysterical performance. He shines brightly in every scene, nailing every line and mannerism, while making this scumbag of a lothario become someone to really care about. He exudes chemistry and helps make everyone else's performance better. Moore and Stone also give great performances, easily balancing the humour with the drama. They are not given nearly as much to do as the guys, but hold their own on- screen.The supporting cast does even better. Bobo is phenomenal in his role, conveying an innocence and naivety that is more mature than I thought possible. He acts like more of an adult than some of the older cast does in many instances, and gives the performance a well-rounded other young actors would be incapable of. Tipton is not nearly as good, but plays the role of a confused teenager a little better than you would imagine. Bacon does great in a small turn as does Liza Lapira as Hannah's best friend. But it is Marisa Tomei who steals the show from everyone, playing one of Cal's conquests. She is dementedly unhinged and ridiculously over-the-top, but never falters. Her performance may be one-note, but it is easily the most memorable thing about the film.If I hold anything against the film (other than the final act stumble and the oh-so convenient way one particular scene comes together), it is that it ended. I know I have harped on how unlike other typical romantic comedies Crazy, Stupid, Love. is, but there is really no other way I can rave about it. I easily could have spent more time with these characters, and pined to find out what happened to each of them after the final fade out. The incredibly unlikely pair of Ficarra and Requa has crafted a truly wonderful and hilarious film that is nothing like what you could have expected watching the trailer. It is bittersweet, and easily one of my favourite movies of the summer. And this is coming from someone who loathes almost every single romantic comedy ever conceived.8.5/10.\",\n",

       " \"There are spoilers in this review...What a great, great movie. If you want to know what being in High School in the mid 70's was like, rent this film. I grew up in the metro Manhattan area. We didn't have the freshman hazing, and few of us could afford the cars (although we sure knew about them and lusted after them), but the rest of this movie is so dead on about my experience of High School in the 70's that it's scary. Every character in the film corresponds with someone that I knew during that time. Yes, there was a lot of pot smoking, yes, obtaining beer was quite easy for underage kids...I used to buy it in bars when I was 16. We made pipes in shop class. We hung out and had parties at night, drove the streets drinking beers and smoking joints listening to the same music. There were no youth centers though. The girls that I knew were as beautiful, and also struggled to get into their jeans. They used pliers too, but they also put them on while they were wet to further get that skintight look. There was no HIV virus to worry about, Herpes was not a big thing then, the biggest worry was getting pregnant. Everyone was having sex... All of these facts also were no big deal. Most of my peers grew up just fine, and now are upstanding pillars of the community. Many today would like you to believe that this is an example of the road to ruin. It was an incredible great time. The film has interesting character development, with the same types I remember. Philosophers, heads (now called stoners), bullies and waifs. This is my American Graffiti and it is perfect. Waxing nostalgic? Perhaps, but anyone that didn't live through that time will sill love the dialog in this film, as it deals with the universal experience of that point in one's life.

The story is riveting, the dialogue is smart and quite funny, and the characters are written in three dimensions.The acting is phenomenal.  Perhaps a bigger tragedy than L.A. Confidential's loss to Titanic in the Best Picture race is that none of the three lead actors even garnered nominations.  Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and Kevin Spacey are absolutely phenomenal; it is their characters that drive this fascinating story about police corruption in 1950s Los Angeles.  We get to know these people, to understand who they are and why they do what they do, and to root for them to overcome their imperfections.The directing is fantastic.  Curtis Hanson doesn't shove anything in the audience's face; instead, he allows the audience to discover the film's nuances on their own.  (That makes this an excellent film for repeat viewings, you truly catch something new every time).  1950s Los Angeles is reproduced beautifully.  The editing is quick and seamless, the music is perfect for the film (Hanson should teach other directors how to do a montage effectively), and the cinematography is great.I can't find a negative thing to say about this film.  It's truly a masterpiece.\",\n",
       " \"Winnie-The-Pooh BLOOD and Honey 2 After walking out of the movie theater, this is without a doubt one of the BLOODIEST, THE BEST, BEAUTIFUL AND BRUTAL LOW BUDGET HORROR Films of this year and does an excellent job. This independent international film from the first film yes I did think two characters from the first film did made it perfect as possible which they did. This film on Winnie-The-Pooh BLOOD and Honey 2 had better cast, better practical effects, Christopher Robin's Flashback, the young Winnie-The-Pooh looks very well done. The dialogue from Tigger sounds similarly to Freddy Krueger and I find that heartwarming, The other dialogues from Owl, Piglet and POOH themselves are definitely the scariest voices that ruins my sisters nightmare forever. The story, writing and script was definitely better as well as cinematography I'd love this film to death and I am excited where this film is going to be in the future, we will see. This 10 Jars of BLOOD & HONEY out of 10 is that perfection. I will see this film again when it comes out on VOD. Winnie-The-Pooh BLOOD and HONEY 2 is definitely one of the best films of this year, Forget SCREAM 6 last year, Winnie-The-Pooh does it incredible and beautiful.\",\n",
       " 'The hype for The Menu intrigued me. The reviews celebrated its genius. So I had to see it. And when I sat in the theater and the credits began to roll, all o could say was, \"Huh?\" The Menu starts with Ready or Not vibes with a fish-out-of-water real-world character who ends up at a fancy dinner with a collection of high society foodies and critics. The trailer gave me expectations of cannibalism cult or Most Dangerous Game-type plots, but instead, nothing really happened. I think I understood what The Menu was trying to convey with its deeper meaning, but I still came up disappointed. Anya Taylor-Joy and the rest of the cast gave great performances, but there was little that really brought the movie together. Maybe the subversion of the cannibal or hunting expectation was the movie\\'s brilliance? The Menu definitely tried to be clever, but whether it was or not might be open to interpretation. Ironically, I sat through the whole movie and left wanting more... left hungry.',\n",

At first you think its about racing cars, but its not it really does give you an insight into the human condition...The rivalry between Hunt and Lauder is just played brilliantly... The race sequences are superb, really taking you back to the 70s... The heyday of this awesome sport. It shows the end of an era where the gentlemen drivers begin to give way to professional sportsmen and the end (in my opinion) of the excitement of the sport. It shows what a pale reflection today's F1 is of this once great sport, and what great characters we have lost...A real must see movie\",\n",

I can actually forgive Ritchie now for his Operation Fortune nonsense.The first hour of this film alone was a great war-action film. It could've ended at that hour and I would've been fully satisfied, impressed and entertained. Then we get the bonus last hour of a separate recon and rescue mission mostly undertaken by one soldier, another epic film on its own.Combine both stories, and you get a flawless film from every aspect, and one that is timely and hits home with a reality check on a bond, a pledge and a commitment. From the stellar directing to the near-perfect screenwriting (aside from nicknaming soldiers in the opening scene with ridiculous names, when those same soldiers become insignificant after half an hour into the film), excellent cinematography, spot-on score - especially the last 15 mins, and stellar casting with outstanding performances by everyone especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim. The running time and pacing were perfect - I actually wanted more. The two hours were pure adrenaline as the remarkable and highly emotional journey unfolded. This film had everything and more, and even some surprising laugh out loud moments: I like what you did with your hair.Alas, Guy Ritchie just out-Guy Ritchied, a Guy Ritchie film. Sheer brilliance from every angle. An epic must see film, and a well deserved 10/10 from me. This one will be in my all-time greatest films collection for sure. It has a hook in me.

       " 'A truly beautiful and hypnotic film.I\\'ve seen the last few Nicholas Winding Refn films, and while I liked both Bronson and Valhalla Rising a lot, they were both \"difficult\" films, in that both structure, pacing and tone were bound to alienate some people, and of course they were both marketed as somewhat mainstream films while being anything but.Part of the irony of Refn\\'s situation is that he makes films about \"Primal\" man- and these protagonists invariably commit acts of great violence on those around them. This violence puts his films into the genre categories that Hollywood recognises and promotes to the public, resulting in trailers for Refn movies that grossly misrepresent the sophistication of the actual film. In that way, Valhalla\\'s intense, slow-burning and almost dialogue-free mythic exploration of our savage past can be repackaged as a \"Vlad the Viking goes to the New World\" action movie.Yet both Valhalla and Bronson were highly \"directed\" films, revealing a very strong hand in control of the material. And so, I was extremely curious to see what Refn would do with the material, and whether he would be able to rein in his sometimes obtrusive style in order to allow the story more room to breathe... I shouldn\\'t have worried. I think the director has managed to balance a genuine artistry with the demands of the genre in a way that is rarely, if ever, achieved. I absolutely loved it. Just stay the hell away from the trailer, as it reveals far too much, and again, misrepresents the film\\'s true \"feel\".Driver has a tone of wry amusement at everything around it, much like Gosling\\'s half-smirk, pivoted on the toothpick perpetually in the corner of his mouth. Schmucky gangsters and mob clichés provide some laughs, but the heart of the film is Gosling\\'s portrayal of the unnamed? main character and his sweet, underplayed romance with Mulligan and her young son. While an ethereal synthesizer-pop soundtrack provides an at-times tender,at-times mythic undercurrent, the car chases and action scenes, when they come, are tense, brutal and brief- far more Eastern Promises than The Transporter. Mulligan plays her character all trembly, wet-eyed, sweet and innocent and is swept away by Gosling\\'s quiet strength and self-assured charm, while Gosling speaks little and remains a mystery to the end, though we never doubt his fundamentally good nature. The seasoned supporting cast are all very fun, except maybe for Kendricks who is relegated to a fairly irrelevant part. Of course, this is really Gosling\\'s film, and he inhabits the character completely, turning what could be a straightforward Hollyood tough-guy role into a complex and contradictory character, self-confident and physical, yet clearly lonely and possessed with a certain peculiarity and stillness, almost reminiscent of De Niro\\'s Travis Bickle.Visually the film is lush and gorgeous. Like Michael Mann, Refn and his cinematographer are able to instill LA with a sense of life and character that most directors just fail to do. Unlike Mann however, Refn opts for warm orange tones over Mann\\'s hard blues, and in one particularly beautiful sequence the familiar LA cliché of driving down the dry LA river is taken to an unexpectedly joyful conclusion. Despite its absolute craftsmanship, Driver is probably not for everybody, which makes me sad. People who prefer bald-headed muscle men slugging and wise-cracking their way into their wallets should of course stay away, as this bears very little resemblance to the standard Hollywood fare associated with the genre, and they might well be disappointed.But for me, Driver was sweet, surreal, mythic, tense, fun, hilarious, revolting, and surprising. See it because it will make you a better person.And so, 10 out of 10, because it deserves it.',\n",
       " \"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.\",\n",

Tom Hulce was a terrific choice for this movie.  True this is historically incorrect but it doesn't matter this film works on so many different levels... the music ahhh the music. Mozart is pure genius and his music touches this film and everyone involved. You can just sense that Mozart's inspiration drove everyone on this film to perfection. A must see film for all!\",\n",
       " 'Is there a better person to play a cyborg than Arnold?  For this movie he was a massively built oak tree of a man.  His strange accent makes for a perfect callous robotic sounding killing machine.  It\\'s almost like his voice is a computer read out ( which I guess it is in one sense ). Terminator is one of those films that started something huge.  People didn\\'t realize it at the time, but the careers of Arnold, Cameron and perhaps even guys like Micahel Biehn, Lance Henriksen and even Bill Paxton were substantially started because of this film.  And Cameron must have liked working with them so much that he gave all of them substantial roles in his next film ( Aliens ).As we all know what the story is, I\\'ll just tell you a bit about what is so fascinating about it.  First I have to mention Michael Biehn.  He has the real starring role.  He is the character that has to explain everything to the audience.  He has to explain this complicated story so that we know what is happening and why.  It is not an easy job to do something like that and still come off looking all right.  But Biehn is simply awesome in this film. A microcosm of his performance can be seen when Sara bites him.  Biehn ( Kyle Reese ) replies \" Terminator\\'s don\\'t feel pain.  I do.  Don\\'t do that again. \"  That is such a great line delivered with the perfect expression, the perfect tone and the perfect timing.  Biehn is perfect for the role.This is also the first film that I saw as a youngster that ever warned me of the dangers of nuclear war and of the rapid advancements of machinery. Perhaps I was too young and naive to fully understand all that James Cameron was trying to say, but now that I am older, I can honestly say that the two Terminators are perfect anti nuke films.  And they are so passionate with what they have to say.  I like it when a film has something to say.  I enjoy being entertained in the process but if you can manage both then you have a masterpiece.  This is a masterpiece.Finally. there are two other reasons to enjoy this film.  One, this is the first film where \"I\\'ll be back\" was spoken.  Now it is part of Arnolds vernacular.  Secondly, Bill Paxton is in it.  And he adds spark to any film that he\\'s in.  Especially here, as the idiot punk leader that really gets the hell beat out of him, he has some great lines.A great film.',\n",
       " 'Beneath was the best Planet of the Apes film bar none. Everything was bigger and better this time around: bigger sets, more gorillas, the whole of New York instead of a mere Statue of Liberty, and, best of all, faceless, telepathic mutants than can kill with the mind. Yes, I was once ten years old.Watched again with many years of hindsight, it\\'s clear that, while entertaining, Beneath was produced without anything approaching artistry. The ultimate in sequels, it tries to tell the same story twice as big, but with only half the success. Until Battle came along and picked the flesh off Apes\\' rotting carcass this was the worst sequel because it did nothing new with the format. Even the working title - Planet of the Apes Revisited - betrays the lack of thought and the desire for finance that went into this one.A virtually identical plotline rattles along at a fair pace, meaning all subtlety is jettisoned. The allegories are also confused by not really being allegories at all. Look at the metaphor for anti-war protestors by casting chimps as ... er, anti-war protestors. A look at how man often judges another man on the colour of his skin is alluded to ... er, by having an ape judging a man on the colour of his skin. (On this note, perversely for a film that purports liberal satire, the only one of the mutants to demonstrate real cruelty was Don Pedro Colley, the sole black character in the film. And despite its worthiness, I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen another film where a man\\'s credit is given as \"Negro\"). However, I did have to smile at the chimp that punningly complains about \"gorilla brutality\".The decreased budget (a sensible studio idea to cut the finance of the sequels to a hit movie) shows with some of the ape extras having decidedly ropy masks in the crowd scenes. The opening of the picture also recaps the first, cannily highlighting the glaring difference between Roddy McDowall\\'s and David Watson\\'s performances as Cornelius. Watson, standing in for an absent McDowall, does reasonably well but really doesn\\'t look anything like him, even under latex. Note too how all the ape masks give the actors lisps, something I never noticed before. Never mind apes, anyone would think James Franciscus had landed on the planet of the Pertwees. There\\'s also some abysmal back projection work when Franciscus is wrestling on top of the horsedrawn carriage. The mutants are pretty good, though their prayers to \"The Holy Fallout\" are a little silly. Why do they wear human masks anyway? Where do they make them? I dunno, I don\\'t make the rules up, do I?Of course, the main problem is the pointless game of one-upmanship it plays with its source. There\\'s no longer any element of surprise that this is Earth, so the ruined monuments, nice as they are, no longer have any great effect. It misses the point, also: the Statue of Liberty is not just a relic, but a symbol. New York Subway is just where people caught trains. And as impressive as the effects are, if not directed well \\x96 which they aren\\'t, particularly \\x96 then it becomes fatuous.It\\'s weird how all four sequels were made within a year of each other, yet at least two of them tried something new. Beneath came two years after the original yet has a rehashed \"in it for the money\" feel all the way through, right down to its abrupt, slightly unsatisfactory climax. Yet despite the many, many faults I\\'ve levelled at it, Beneath the Planet of the Apes is still a very enjoyable film. Not in the sense of the first, which genuinely had something to say, but in the guise of pulp SF then this sequel is well worth seeing. In fact, despite the slating I\\'ve given it, I still awarded it 6/10.',\n",
       " 'Boogie Nights is perhaps one of the greatest examples any would-be filmmaker should take a long hard look at.  Sure, you could spend loads of quality time reviewing the clasics from Hitchcock to Scorsese; but lets follow suit for the modern generation and study half-heartedly.Where to begin, I suppose one could look at the film as simply a story, perhaps even docudrama which focuses on the late 1970\\'s porn industry-and what an industry it was!  The other half could focus on the incredible detail one brillant filmmaker can achieve simply by using polyester and *ahem* rubber.  But honestly, Boogie Nights brings back the pure, no-bul!shi$, in your face kind of cinema I haven\\'t experienced since the film greats of the 1970\\'s...ironic...or stroke of genius.  The story is full of richly detailed characters, all of which you either can relate too, love, or hate; but the impact is clear-you are feeling something for them.  Among the characters the two performances which stand out are: Burt Reynolds as Director Jack Horner, and Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams/Dirk Diggler. Julianne Moore is also brillant, as is Heather Graham...but if I focus on any one actor it would have to be John C. Reilly.  John\\'s performance is a perfect balance of comedic timing and character driven emotion...I\\'m a sucker for the line \"Ever see the movie Star Wars?...People say I look like Han Solo.\"  Anyway, the look of the film is incredible, the Director of Photography and Director/Writer/Producer, have come up with a vibrant colour, and flashy style that compares to Martin Scorsese, and Stanley Kubrick(in terms of his perfection of his craft); but with creating his own unique look, and pushing the edge with the longest single shot I\\'ver ever seen...that being the New Year\\'s party sequence.The music, like in any great film, is a character of its own.  At times, it consumes oneself with sorrow or grief...but mainly its all about fun, dancing, and having a good time; the spirit of the 1970\\'s. OK, back to the performances.Burt Reynolds plays the character of Jack Horner, a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of \"film\" means to his genre.  The awful transition from shooting on film to recording on magnetic tape. The lose of his art, as it were...and the changes in mentality to the people he works with.  Walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocense and sexual bravado needed for the character.  For all those individuals who have seen Burton\\'s Planet of the Apes, pay no attention to the performance of Wahlberg in that film...rent boogie nights and see what a difference a good script can make!Julianne Moore plays the would-be mother to all, and with that comes the torment and anguish she feels, as life imitates art; and she loses all those close to her.  Heather Graham is the eye-candy, but later holds her own, and steals some of the scenes from even the great Mr. Reynolds himself.  Each character is multidimensional, rich with life, and performed by actors that seem to be picture perfect for the part.The film itself is often funny, tragic, exciting, and provides a uncompromising look into the turblulant lifestyle of the fast-pace 1970\\'s. It makes no excuses, and tells no lies; and offers the audience a trip back. But even more importantly, the movie gives us a grand example of how films should be made; and a new director whose bold visions bring back art in film.',\n",
       " 'D&D: HAT, as I like to call it, suffers from a massive identity crisis as it tries to cater to players and particularly old grognards who have played the game forever as well as people who have no relationship to the game and, of course, children. The result is a coy hodge podge of PG nonsense with almost no story, at least an hour of exposition, and a whole lot of snark. This film is so much less than the sum of those parts, more than two hours of bad \"jokes\" and terrible accident. The most disappointing part, however, is the CGI, which is just terrible for some reason. It is painful to watch.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve never understood the critical slam this film has received. Then I saw the widescreen dvd version and understood; everyone has been watching it in pan and scan! The film is a visual poem. So much of the story telling is done through visual information. The impact of this is lost when the cinematography is altered. Remember that Nestor Almendros received an Academy Award nomination for his work on this film. The film has resonated with global audiences for so long for this very reason. I suggest people watch the dvd commentary with Randal Kleiser and Brooke Shields to get a better understanding of why this film is still such a popular one.\\nPeople attack the acting, but these are children left alone with no one to guide them into adult sophistication. Their interaction and reactions to situations are very consistent with this scenario. Yes, the birth scene is a little rushed, but do we really need to see the umbilical cord? Not all films need to be about gritty reality, ala \"Taxi Driver.\" No one asks to see the bloody guts of the smashed witch in \"The Wizard of Oz.\"It is a beautiful, romantic film that speaks to millions of people. It seems that only the most skeptical cynics cannot embrace this film.',\n",
       " \"Review: By Morgan StewartIt is hard to put into writing just how marvelous and wonderful Bridge to Terabithia really is, yet as I attempt it, I can't help feeling disturbed at how ridiculous people are being about the marketing of this film. Thank goodness most real critics have looked past the agreeably deceptive marketing, into the heart and beauty of this film, which, with or with the misleading advertisements is impressive. After seeing it, I struggled to think of a better way of marketing this film, without giving away its ending or taking away the only audience that still seems to watch PG movies, kids.After watching it, however, I couldn't imagine taking anyone under ten to see it, nor could I imagine anyone under ten enjoying it as much as young adults, or even older audiences would. So, as deceptive as the advertising was, I myself realize that the fascinating story, the charm and skill of the actors, and the good direction of newcomer to live action film-making, Gabor Csupo, more than makes up for the slightly skewed first impressions. And I am eternally grateful that it did not turn into what everyone seemed to want, a cheesy Narnia rip-off. If anything, the movie was a lot better than the preview made it seem to be, and I was pleasantly surprised.Instead of the brash and rude approach to filming movies, that seems to be the standard today with effects driven movies, Terabithia focuses on the characters, the story, and the heart when telling this beautiful tale. Which, is part of the reason why I enjoyed it so much. Too often now days the story is built around the effects, not around the characters. A rather cumbersome and annoying way to tell a story, or be told a story, if you ask me. Instead, Terabithia uses the talents of both the amazing young actors, and its adult cast to enthrall and absorb the viewer in the magic of imagination and the reality of every-day life.The story focuses on young Jess Aarons, whose school life and home life aren't all that ideal. He deals with bullies at school, and four sisters at home. Josh Hutcherson, who I haven't particularly enjoyed before, plays the part of Jess perfectly, his emotions and reactions spot on, throughout.What is a school without the new girl? Leslie Burke, played by AnnaSophia Robb, takes on the part of the imaginative and friendly new girl and brings to Jess gifts of imagination and friendship. Robb truly does a superb job in bringing to life the thoughtful and imaginative Leslie Burke.All of the supporting cast was also brilliantly portrayed. I especially enjoyed the performances of Robert Patrick as Jess's father, and young Bailee Madison as Jess's little sister May Belle.Together, Jess and Leslie create a world to call their own. A place that no one else can get to, a place in their imaginations. Terabithia, a land of beautiful creatures and dangerous enemies, springs forth from their imaginations, and becomes a place to call their own, away from the bullies and monotony of everyday life.What really struck me as brilliant was the limited, yet still perfect number of glimpses into the children's' imaginations. We don't see a lot of Terabithia, which is good, because it is more about the journey of the characters, than the land of Terabithia. That said, it still has quite a few more scenes of adventure than the book by Katherine Patterson, all of which add to, not take away from the story.The writing, also is quite good. David Patterson, son of the novel's author takes great care when adapting the beloved work of his mother into a screenplay. Most of the lines from the book aren't there, but there are a few which make it in, revealing the care and love that was put into the scripting of this movie. Personally, I enjoy the screenplay of the movie more than the words of the book, but that is just my opinion. The movie's script greatly aided in the believability of the characters, and the motion of the scenes, which were crisp and well-planned.The movie touched on my every emotion, bringing me to tall peaks of happiness and leaving me teary-eyed and disconsolate, but still had a perfect and satisfying ending. I also, personally thought, the scenes and situations were more powerful, poignant, and realistic, than the book, which surprises me. Usually, the movie can't live up to the book. In this case, the phrase seemed switched around. The book didn't live up to the movie. As weird as it is for me to say this about a movie, Terabithia touched my heart like no film has ever before. And I doubt any film will give me quite the same feeling, ever again.\",\n",

The acting was wonderful, emotional and nuanced, with some unforgettable moments (The two leads - Gyllenhaal and Jackman - give their career best performances, but the biggest achievement in my opinion is Paul Dano's). The musical score contributes to a sense of dread, as well as the rich sound design and the chilly color palette of the breathtaking cinematography.All those parts add up to a rare, gut-wrenching, dark and fascinating masterpiece - the kind that lingers with you long after the credits roll.\",\n",
       " '\"Sicario\" describes, with surgical precision, the fatal and bloody desecration of Mexico as a result of its decades long cartel war. And it does so by compressing this almost endless tragedy into a two-hour tour-de-force of filmmaking. At its center we find idealistic FBI-Agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), who is recruited to pursue a Mexican drug-baron. She is being guided by a seemingly untouchable covert assassin named Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). Their investigation and methods are pushed further into unknown territory where justice and morality are no longer valid. The end not only justifies the means, it requires them.Denis Villeneuve\\'s masterful piece exemplifies not only filmmaking of the highest order, but carves out a place alongside the terrible news reports as a deeply regretful, angry and at times almost unbearable look into the abyss of a socio-political nightmare that is fueled by first world-habit and global economics.Through the powerful performances by Blunt, Del Toro and Josh Brolin in the leads as well as the excellent supporting cast, do we get a sense of the human cost (physical and psychological), which the war on drugs has taken.From an exploding prison population, to the destruction of Mexican agriculture, to refugees and a cycle of violence that is beyond barbarity; the pull that \"Sicario\" exerts over the viewer is undeniable and by skirting the limits of bearable tension, without ever becoming exploitive, it is never giving an inch concerning its subject matter.Few movies this year will have such a clear and defined structure and unflinching approach towards a situation that appears to be beyond salvation, while showing at the same time, that life nevertheless continues.Taylor Sheridan\\'s script doesn\\'t miss a single beat and without sidestepping anything frees itself from beaten movie conventions by using familiar elements in an extremely skillful manner.All these themes, stories and characters are captured through the lens of veteran Roger Deakins (Skyfall, No Country for Old Men) who lets us always know how the micro- and macro-particles of any conflict are inextricably intertwined. We share the vistas of beautiful sceneries while having to witness their downfall. Whatever ideals the likes of Emiliano Zapata once had, their country has now, as it is described in the movie, become \\x84the land of wolves\". Fifteen years ago Steven Soderbergh\\'s \\x84Traffic\" which earned numerous Oscars, not the least of which went to Benicio Del Toro, made a clear statement about the various strands the drug trafficking business touches. Now, all those years later we see in \\x84Sicario\" that even the faintest of hopes that \\x84Traffic\" held onto have been eviscerated. What now? One might ask.',\n",

An examination, satire, critique of a time, and type of thinking.\\nEven before seeing the ending, I thought how much bateman lives in people. Found myself thinking, an examination of bateman is an examination of men by the name of Reagan and Bush. How American Psycho is an examination of our times, and our modern theologies.I found the movie as a whole riveting, loved the restraint shown (and disagree with those calling for more gore, I think Mary should be applauded for her deft hand, the scenes have more power for what is not shown), and was captivated by nearly every scene, by scenes others have called boring, but I found profound.Bateman putting on his makeup, or simply trying to get a restaurant, and the near apocalyptic importance, such minutiae makes in the lives of empty men. The right card, or the right cloth, or the right table, or the right watch, how these are the signposts of an empty age and an empty soul, and how these things have more value than your fellow man... or woman.Bateman attains everything the materialistic times tells him he should want, but once he gets it he feels nothing. Emptier than before, less than before. It\\'s only in the extremes of his addictions he begins to feel something, anything. He feeds to fill the emptiness, but the more he feeds the emptier he gets. He eats at his fellowman (woman) but in his bloodlust he eats at himself.He is the American dream, taken to its cannibalistic extremes.And never before has makeup, played such a mesmerizing part in a movie. Bateman\\'s(Chris Bale\\'s) face at times when he is under stress, takes on a plastic look, a glossy, sweaty sheen, and for all the world it looks like he\\'s wearing a mask... and the mask, his mask of sanity, is beginning to run.Simply amazing use of makeup. And incredible performance by the lead actor. I wasn\\'t familiar with him before this, but everyone will be after this.Upon first hearing about this movie, I had no desire to see it. I\\'ve grown up since the age of Hills Have Eyes and trash like The Beyond, watching people suffer no longer seems significant. I guess as we get older we ask more of our art than springer, or the WWF, or slasher flicks. We ask of our art to tell us something true. Something of ourselves, and our world.I think American Psycho under the deft hand of Mary Harron becomes more than my prejudices, and exceeds my expectations. Rises at times to dizzying heights not unlike art.Mary\\'s restraint makes this movie. But I fear her restraint nearly sinks it as well. The ending is too ambiguous. Who is Bateman in the end. Is there a Bateman? And what did he do or did not do?In the end,the movie will nag at you. Did he or didn\\'t he? And in the end, now that I write this I\\'m thinking maybe the answer doesn\\'t really matter, maybe in the end the answer is the same. In the end a sin of thought, or a sin of action, is still a sin. In the end we are left with a man, and a nation... whose mask is slipping.\\nI think like the first Psycho, time will prove this one.... worthy. I now add Mary Harron to the small selection of modern directors I will tiptoe through broken glass to see. Directors like Dave Fincher(Seven, Fight Club), Carl Franklin(Devil in a Blue Dress), Johnny To(Expect the Unexpected), Ringo Lam(Full Alert, Victim), M. Night Shyamalan(Sixth Sense, Unbreakable), and Peter Weir(Fearless).Recommended.',\n",

       " \"Netflix finally made a good high budget action movie that strays away from the high budget action comedies with middle of the road action and comedy they have been making like Red Notice and The Man From Toronto. All this movie needed was great action and enjoyable character performances and a serviceable story and it delivers. The action in this movie can range from a little choppy to very slick but it's overall really good. Chris Evans as a villainous maniac is absolutely amazing to watch and Ryan Gosling and Ana De Armas are simply bad asses. Definitely worth seeing in the theater rather than Netflix.\",\n",
       " 'I am a passionate climber and I love to watch any movie that contains climbing scenes. And boy! This movie does not disappoint! This is movie Gold.The first climbing scene on the sandstone cliff face was totally realistic; climbing side-by-side on multi-pitch ascents is exactly what all awseome climbers do. None of those established commands like \\'Safe\\', \\'On-belay\\', or \\'Climbing\\' and other crap. Safety weakens the mind !! I spent a lot of time studying their climbing style to assess their techniques. As I was watching it became clear that these \"Masters of the Indoor Wall\" had taken all their climbing lessons from watching films like \"vertical limit\" and \"cliff hanger\" because their technique was flawless. Did I mention the girls\\' super human strength? The way they managed to brake their climbing mate\\'s surprise fall by simply grabbing - with one hand - a pole while standing on tiny platform is totally realistic. I should know because I do that all the time. Just like I always unlock my carabiner and unhook myself from the rope with one arm while suspended and hanging freely in the rope.Guys, this is a must see film.In fact they should take the best elements from this movie and make it into an instruction video for aspiring climbing instructors. They can call the video \"how to safely crater into the desert floor\" (I hereby waive any royalty claims for that suggestion).If this doesn\\'t win Oscars and awards for movie realism, I\\'ll be profoundly disappointed. Finally I want everyone to recognize true expertise which is often forgotten: The technical advisors they used for the climbing scenes did a stellar job and are probably receiving sooooo many calls right now from directors who are fighting tooth and nail to get them to join their projects.That\\'s it. My review is done. I off to free-solo the Nose. After having watched this awesome instruction film, how hard can it be? Right?',\n",
       " 'I loved this film for many reasons. For one, the switch from a crime thriller to a horror thriller was seamless. I for one had not heard much about this film before I watched it, and I assumed the TV Times were mistaken in called this a gory horror thriller. To me, it was a simple crime thriller, the norm which is expected from Tarantino\\'s pen. However, the switch was such a shock and so fast, that I didn\\'t now what happened I was amazed at this revelation, since there was no word of any horror topics beforehand in the script. It was completely out of the blue, and resulted in a pleasant surprise.And the thing that\\'s interesting is that BOTH halves to this film, both the crime section and horror section are enjoyable. The first half has less action, but tension does mount between Keitel and Clooney, while Tarantino is in the back, paying special attention to Keitel\\'s daughter. A great premise with an equally great script in the first half. The second section is also great because of the horrific violence and as I heard mentioned before, the unique ways on how to kill vampires.The script is witty and full of dark humour, \"I have 6 little friends and they all run faster than you.\", and the intro is certainly one of the best I have seen in months. The characters are well established, with Clooney as the \\'gentleman\\' (well, not really) crook, Tarantino as his psychotic brother (who, strangely, I found difficult not to warm to) and Keitel is the preacher who has lost his faith, the hostage who will help out later when the satanic hordes unleash themselves.A special mention must go to Salma Hayek for that special dance. ;) While this film was never made out of blockbuster material, it is still very understated, taking a unique and perhaps surreal viewing on the horror genre, all the while using horror stereotypes. As far as graphic violence is concerned, it is on par with the likes of Evil Dead (well, perhaps not THAT bad).For once, this is a film which doesn\\'t give the viewer all the answers beforehand. You are in the same boat as the characters and you don\\'t know what\\'s in store for them. If you hadn\\'t seen this before, without any knowledge of the movie, you\\'d be in for a huge surprise as I was.An 8/10 for it\\'s script (thanks to Tarantino) and the actors who, while not trying too hard, make this an enjoyable horror flick with a difference.',\n",

To say that these two are good actors is like saying that a nuclear bomb makes a loud noise and in this movie they prove why they are at the top of their respective crafts .Al Pacino is the standout in the ensemble cast and its amazing how his eyes have changed from the first part .

       " 'So I saw the long awaited \"Prometheus\" tonight. Overall, rather good, but the characters annoyingly and jarringly flaunted so many basic health and safety regulations regarding potential contamination, infection, quarantine and exposure to physical injury from not wearing adequate safety equipment in an unfamiliar extra-terrestrial environment etc. Maybe we\\'re just supposed to be careless or stupid in about 80 years\\' time. Tsk! Also, while not being pro-god or creationist as such, it did kind of take a dump on Darwinism and the role of evolution in our existence.Being in 3D was fairly pointless. I even had to check that it was by taking the glasses off. It was, but barely noticeable.Gorgeous sets and imagery, but I wasn\\'t too happy about what the Engineers or \"Space Jockeys\" look like under their bio-mechanical suits.It was plagued by thoroughly unbelievable and rather unprofessional characters as well. Dumb scientists and ship crew lacking the professional integrity you\\'d expect from a trillion dollar mission. Oh, and the old Weyland guy was a bit rubbish. Just Guy Pearce with lame prosthetic wrinkles. How about using an actual old man actor with an actual old bone structure? He stuck out like a sore thumb. Anyway, I have to pick fault, but it\\'s very much worth a watch and most people aren\\'t as picky as me I guess.I still wish they\\'d stop making films as if we\\'re all dumb 15 yr old kids without any real intelligence though.

The costumes, colorful presentation, musical soundtrack, designs, and the structures are all great. All of the performances are good as Alicia Vikander and Jude Law have great chemistry both volatile, smart, and love. The writing has some interesting concepts, themes, and atmospheres explored which I enjoyed, although some being predictable. The camerawork, unfortunately, is the worst aspect because the camerawork felt flat and usually Aïnouz approach on the camerawork is pretty good but here, it feels too flat which made certain moments feel lifeless.Overall, it's not one of Karim Aïnouz best works but I thought it was ambitious and still engaging throughout.\",\n",

       " '\"How happy is the blameless vestal\\'s lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray\\'r accepted, and each wish resign\\'d.\" - Alexander PopeMichel Gondry\\'s \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a bizarre but wonderful movie, a very strange and remarkably tender experience, which I suppose is only to be expected from screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, the man behind \"Being John Malkovich.\"The film was produced by Focus Features (\"Lost in Translation,\" \"21 Grams\"), a company which strives to offer original, quality films to the true cinema lovers. If the company keeps producing films this good, they may become hugely successful in the future, if not already.The previews portrayed the movie as a bouncy, cheery comedy in the vein of \"Adaptation,\" the last film written for the big screen by Charlie Kaufman, when it is really a tender movie about love and romance. This is Jim Carrey\\'s best performance to date, and may open the eyes of his prejudiced haters who have only imagined him as Ace Ventura and a certain cable guy for his entire career. No snippy quotes, outrageous humor or bizarre antics in \"Sunshine\" -- Carrey plays a true, realistic, three-dimensional character named Joel Barrish, who plans to have memories of his girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet), erased by a new company called Lacuna, after he discovers that she herself has had the procedure performed only a week before. Joel meets with the company\\'s founder, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), and is informed that the procedure -- although \"technically\" brain damage -- is on par with a heavy night of drinking. \"Nothing you\\'ll miss much,\" he is told, as he plunges into a bizarre world of long forgotten memories.The entire process of the operation is quite fascinating, really, if a bit reminiscent of an idea founded by none other than one of Kaufman\\'s favorite writers, Philip K. Dick, who wrote the source short story for the Ah-nuld movie \"Total Recall.\" All items relating to the person you want erased from your brain are assembled together, and the technicians at Lacuna (Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood) then \"map\" an outline of your memories, which are supposedly stemmed together. I have my doubts about the seriousness and remote possibility of such a procedure being performed, and the explanation is quite simply utter bull, but we don\\'t care because the entire erasing of Joel\\'s memories serves as a backdrop for a deeper meaning: If you could forget about past romances, would you really want to? And if so, would you be willing to sacrifice all the good ones, along with the bad ones?The conclusion that \"Sunshine\" arrives at is, to be totally truthful, as honest as can be. During the procedure, Joel\\'s subconscious realizes that it doesn\\'t want to let go of its memories of Clementine, and so begins a strange labyrinth of fragmented memories, constantly changing surroundings, and mental materializations of Clementine. The movie is like a very bizarre dream, when you\\'re trying to interact with people, but they\\'re not responding, and you shout and try to get their attention but they don\\'t seem to notice. Joel\\'s entire odyssey of the interior of his mind makes \"Being John Malkovich\" look normal -- but as I didn\\'t like \"Malkovich\" very much, and thought its strangeness was unjustified, it fits perfectly in \"Sunshine\" -- there are some great special effects, such as when Joel is wandering through his own memories, drifting in and out of sleep, hearing the voices of the technicians erasing his memories and watching as objects and areas around him vanish and deconstruct. It\\'s so bizarre but yet also so beautiful. Gondry was a former music video director (his complete works are available on DVD) and he is the perfect candidate for this project, having worked with Kaufman before on the 2001 flop \"Human Nature.\" It seems that he has finally found a unique directing style that ties in perfectly with the underlying themes of the movie.There is a very deep message in \"Sunshine,\" and it is arguably Kaufman\\'s deepest film to date. Love and romance and memories of both have rarely been examined as thought-provokingly and tenderly as they are in this wonderful motion picture. The movie has a very profound message that all viewers should pay attention to. There are many small intricacies in the film, surely picked up on more thoroughly on repeat viewings, and the entire construction of the movie is completely enthralling and intelligent. I saw two people leave the rather empty theater during the screening I attended. It tanked in the US and I predict it will do the same in the UK, which is a shame, because this is the smartest film of 2004 and has the most to say about our lives than any other film this year. While everyone flocks to see the new Denzel Washington action movie, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is forgotten, which is quite depressing -- people would rather spend their money on forgettable entertainment than view something unique that has something important at its core.I think what the movie finally asks us after its long, emotional journey, is would we want our own memories erased? And if so, what would the consequences be? A lesser film might examine this idea poorly -- \"Sunshine\" is not. It is perfect in almost every conceivable way, and anyone who complains that it is not original must be joking -- in my entire lifetime, this is one of the most unique film experiences I have ever had.\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a beautiful movie, eloquently voiced by Gondry, firmly constructed and rooted in an eerie nightmarish fantasy land where anything is possible. It\\'s beautiful, it\\'s bizarre, it\\'s exceptional, it\\'s funny, it\\'s lovely, it\\'s touching, it\\'s witty, and it\\'s one of the best movies I have ever seen.',\n",
       " 'Unfortunately, we make very few films here in Australia, and we rarely make great films, that\\'s why when a fairly ok movie comes out, we all get excited.

This is not a boring film, or am awful experience, however, it\\'s really not that great. Of course, we all get sentimental when we see the Australian landscape photographed in a movie, it\\'s close to our hearts and we get touched by it. This film has all the ingredients to potentially have been a great film, but that opportunity was missed. The story has many holes, the constant flashbacks get confusing, the performances are not that great, Eric Bana has no chemistry with anyone on the screen, the soundtrack is nonstop and aimless, and annoying. The dialogue is also poorly done. Very basic screenwriting, nothing sophisticated, very much on-the-nose. I understand the desire to portray the simplicity of the characters being a country/rural setting, however, films like Coen Brothers\\' \"Fargo\" achieve this without compromising the integrity of the dialogue. This definitely didn\\'t live up to the hype. Watch it of course to support our home-grown. film industry, but we really need to up our game.',\n",
       " 'Very seldom in Hollywood are movies produced that are as emotionally involving as \\'One Day.\\' It\\'s a beautiful, beautiful love story of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dex (Jim Sturgess). After spending the night together after graduation, we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met; to see where they are or where they\\'re not. Based on the book by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), \\'One Day\\' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.First let me say film acting is what I believe makes or breaks a movie - if the actors are great, the movie is generally great. That\\'s not to take away from any other element of film at all, but when everything else is done so well, if the acting were bad, the film would have been less memorable. But Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are so very impressive here. They make their characters real and relatable, which are two key things every actor internally wishes they could do. In fact, as an on-screen pair, they work extremely well, together they exude chemistry.What I found most interesting about the entire experience was that I cared so much. I became enamoured with their lives. I kept hoping for the best. I anticipated what would happen to each of them. I sat forward, sat backward. I laughed and I cried. I\\'ve said many times before, a great movie will effect you emotionally in more ways than one. You\\'ll be angry, you\\'ll be happy, you\\'ll be sad - the key is that you emote. This movie presented all of those elements. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It\\'s as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. Far too often, characters in Hollywood seem contrived and are not genuine. \\'One Day\\' is honestly one of the most genuine stories ever told - there is no instant gratification, there is however frustration and that is the beauty of it all. It explores love and love lost, it explores friendship and the constraints of time and distance. It explores each character\\'s journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. So many little pieces of the puzzle are filled in between the years by simple, single lines of dialogue or actions. It\\'s not the typical script of \"everything\\'s all good-obstacle-everything ends well\" - there\\'s a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine.So many little details, like eye-lines, smiles, sighs, cut-off conversations, etc. were paid attention to. The costuming, cinematography and score were spot on and all noteworthy. All of it combined was moving and awe-inspiring. I left the theater crying, but it didn\\'t stop there, even thinking about the movie and those characters is deeply affecting. Maybe there are some underlying themes in the film that I\\'m identifying with, or maybe, just maybe the actors were really that great. Whatever it is, this film comes with my highest recommendation, is rated PG-13 and runs 107 minutes.',\n",
       " 'This film surprised me in a good way.From the trailer and the posters to be found in many of the bus shelters of our town it would have been fair to have expected a routine rom-com. The pose struck by the leads Jake Gylenhall & Anne Hathaway on that poster just screamed \"knock about rom-com,just like hundreds of others\" It isn\\'t though and that was a pleasant and engaging surprise.Jake Gylenhall pulls off the role of super bright but super slacker son Jamie in a high achieving family well and is convincing as a magnetising presence that women find irresistible.The absence of Anne Hathaway\\'s character Maggie in the first segment of the film is the first suggestion that this will not be a routine paint by numbers romance and Maggie\\'s introduction sets the scene for the complex character she successfully portrays.This film covers a lot of ground and both of the leads are engaging and believable.Issues such as serious illness, the workings of the big pharmaceutical companies and their attempts to influence the decision making of medical professionals, the struggle people have to pay for treatment and a believably complex love story are woven in without significant signposting or obvious plot twists.Once again, the two lead actors were excellent and overall this made for an enjoyable and engaging film',\n",
       " 'I came to the film with low expectations.  I was simply stunned by how good it was.Angelina Jolie is an absolutely PHENOMENAL actress. Her performance alone is worth watching the movie for. But unlike show-stoppers like Marissa Tomei in \"My Cousin Vinnie,\" merely shines the brightest light in a luminescent cast.The cinematography was innovative, but not distractingly so-- \"Girl Interupted\" shines primarily for its dramatic power, not as a mind-blowing work of art. It will not explode your vision of the mundane world in the same way that \"American Beauty\" might, but it will certainly probe you to question your way of seeing the world-- at least psychologically.Winona Ryder challenged my preconception of her, and proved herself as more than a pretty-girl. Her performance was convincing as Suzanna, a confused high-school graduate who is eloquent and insightful on paper yet unable to a rticulate her own desperate melancholy.The movie takes place primarily in the women\\'s ward of a mental institution and follows the dynamic friendship between Lisa (Jolie\\'s character) and Suzanna. Lisa is a kinetic, dynamic personality who cuts right to the \"truth\" of things. Her \"truth\" knows no boundaries and she is a controlling person prone to violence. Her piercing insights about people and social recklessness led to her to be institutionalized as a sociopath.This is not a depressing film. Rather, it is suprisingly life-affirming. Not cloying, not sacherine, but not inpenetrably dark, either.  Anyone seeking an angst-ridden portrayal of abuses in mental institutions should check out Jack Nicholson\\'s \"One Flew Over the Cuckoos nest.\"This film has little of the violent anger of that old classic. Yet it does echo some of the ebulience, the defiance of authority and embracing of freedom at sometimes incalculable cost.Performances by Whoppie Goldberg (in a serious and nuanced role) and Vanessa Redgrave were excellent, as expected.With the exception of a few holywood gimmicks, predictable cuts and music, this is a nearly flawless film. Dead-on dramatically, and excellently scripted and based on an eloquent true-story by Suzana Keisen, this movie offers a glimpse of one intensely personal experience of truth. Without the quotation marks, dark cynicism, or pretensions that revelation so frequently entails.',\n",

Where every aspect that makes his films special was at its peak. The characters, the cast, the sets and, of course, the visuals were up to an 11. His craft was perfected - and it's one of my top 5 films of all time.When I saw Isle of Dogs, I started to feel full. I felt like I had seen Wes's style a bit too much. And now this.I feel that Asteroid City is pretty bland. The visuals are fantastic - but we've seen this all before. Instead of a compelling lead who has an interesting problem to solve - we get several bland characters who are quirky, and that's it. The acting is great though. But it's not that funny nor intriguing.We were eight friends who saw this film together. Every one of us was pretty bored after a while.

       " \"To start off; This is the one and only film that kept me quiet for a whole 5 mins after seeing it. I literally couldn't close my mouth, and yet there wasn't any sound coming out of it. Oldboy had such an impact on me that words are too little to describe that impact. Therefore this film is definitely in my top 3 films ever made. It belongs there because it has a massive ingredient that a lot of films seem to miss out on; a divine plot. Even though the acting and screenplay are world class, the plot is really the cherry on the cake.When it comes to screenplay Park Chan-Wook is unique (at least for western standards) in his way of filming. The colours are so vivid and it seems like he wanted every shot to be a piece of art. One tip: If you like the shooting in 'Oldboy', have a look at 'Sympathy for Lady Vengeance', the third part in Park's revenge-trilogy. It's even superior to the camera-work in 'Oldboy'. Don't, however, expect a story like Oldboy's, because you would be very disappointed.When it comes to acting and the music, this film is also one of the better films ever made. The music sticks in your head and every time I put in my Oldboy-DVD and the theme-song comes up, I'm just flooded with good memories (even though the plot doesn't have a single reason to be happy about). The characters are also presented very well by the outstanding cast. Especially Choi Min-Sik and Yu Ji-Tae set a very convincing performance. I really appreciate this film being respected as it should be, by having a place in the top 250. If, however, it was up to me it would be even higher in the ranking. I don't see why films like 'The Usual Suspects' or 'Memento', which are fantastic pieces of film-making and which without a doubt deserve a place in the top 250, are higher in the top 250 than 'Oldboy'. They serve the same cause; a fantastic plot. But those plots can't stand in the shadow or even come close to the plot of 'Oldboy'. The one and only reason is that those two films are better known and from a western production company. If we were all living in Asia, no doubt 'Oldboy' would be in the top 20 of all time. My advice to people who haven't watched this film yet: Go see it! This is definitely a must- see. If you have a weak stomach, pull yourself together and still watch it. Don't be as shallow as a lot of people here tend to be. Look beyond the violence and see the things I mentioned before: world class acting, cinematography, music and last but certainly not least the plot. Once you've opened yourself up you'll find a whole new world of cinema. Enjoy!\",\n",

Although the Maitlands remain invisible to Charles and Delia, their daughter Lydia can see Adam and Barbara and becomes their friend. Against the advice of Juno, the Maitlands contact the miscreant Betelgeuse, a freelance \"bio-exorcist\", to scare away the Deetzes, but they have their hands full now with this crazy psycho.Beetlejuice is an awesome movie, it\\'s one of the funniest movies you\\'ll see. I will be honest, it\\'s a strange humor as it\\'s a dark comedy, but it\\'s all good. Seriously Michael Keaton is such a great comedic actor, he was the perfect choice, he brought the right amount of cockiness and comedy to the role. Also Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin had great chemistry as well as the perfect Leave it to Beaver-esquire type of couple that has a hard time accepting their world as the afterlife. Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O\\'Hara and Winona Ryder were perfect as the Deetzes, quite disturbing and awkward. I highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it, it\\'s a great comedy classic.10/10',\n",
       " \"We two 50+ grandmas went to see this film on the spur of the moment because we enjoy musical movies. We were probably the oldest people in the audience which ranged down to younger teens but everyone, regardless of age, was laughing and having a grand time. Much less schmaltzy and self-serious than Glee, but wonderful vocals and dancing and personality. You can't help but fall in love with the hilariously quirky characters, especially Rebel Wilson as the irrepressible Fat Amy, Elizabeth Banks as Gail, the sexually frustrated female announcer, and Hanna Mae Lee as Lilly, the wackadoo who releases the most shocking comments in a voice that barely exceeds a murmur. Fun, feel-good and highly entertaining.\",\n",
       " \"You can tell when a scary scene's coming, which made it suck for me because the build ups weren't great. The actors seemed to put effort into making it engaging, but their efforts only went so far.This horror movie revolves around a swimming pool. After the first frightful event occurred, everything felt like a stretch. It feels more suited to being a short film, but even then it could've been drawn out better. The concept seems derivative, reminiscent of horror movies that have already been done before. A supernatural entity grants wishes but at a cost, a trope seen not only in horror but in other film genres. The only deviation here is that instead of a magical bean or demonic entity, it's a swimming pool.They should have trimmed down the family-focused moments and delved deeper into the pool's eldritch origins. I anticipated an exploration of its history, envisioning a showcase of people worshipping it, perhaps rooted in Native American mythology and folklore. And the monsters sucked, looked like copses from a cop show, there could have been more imaginative entities. For instance, a tale about an evil witch who once granted wishes, was drowned in the springs, and now her soul resides there. Something. Anything!It's frustrating when horror movies fail to be scary, that's bare minimum expectation. Dictionary definition of the genre. This story should have been crafted to instill genuine fear of swimming pools. There was immense potential left untapped.The monsters weren't scary. The ending wasn't all that. 'something has you, you need to fight it' is so overused, it's fine if the movie is decent but when the movies boring, it doesn't work. This movie is 90min but like a never-ending 3-hour ordeal. It's more of a family drama than a horror movie. It's like the director crafted a drama centered around a family coping with a superstar dad grappling with an MS diagnosis, but then studio said no, make it a horror. And it's terrible at that.\",\n",
       " 'But WHY is it great?1. Visually. From the very first moments of the film, my mouth was hanging open. I mean, what the hell? Nothing looks this good. I have no idea how they made the cars look so much like real cars, and STILL make them look so much like characters. And the settings? Having grown up and traveled all over the South West United States (including more than one pilgrimage down Route 66) They captured, not only the visuals, but the atmosphere and character America\\'s Main Street Perfectly. Frankly, if you put real actors in many of the scenes, you wouldn\\'t realize it was computer generated\\x85 you know, if the landscape wasn\\'t made up of old car parts.2. Creativity. Talking animals. Every cartoon HAS to have talking animals. Only so many cartoons can be about talking animals trying to bamboozle around with humans. Thank goodness for Cars. They create an entirely believable world populated by machines, with tractor cows, and somehow they still have George Jones and Hendrix. The story IS quite predictable, but it\\'s still quite creative. With this level of creative juice flowing in one of John\\'s babies, I can\\'t wait to see what he has in store for further feature animation and theme parks.3. Characters. I have a beef with Hollywood. They have no idea what life in a small town is like. They either try and stuff their ideals and attitude into a western shirt, or else fill America\\'s heartland with dolts, \"we don\\'t like outsiders\" sheriffs, or crazed murderers. Thankfully, Pixar did their homework and featured small town folk as they really are: eclectic, eccentric, loyal, creative with their fun, friendly with visitors, and really worth while. The subtle touches, such as the lovable rivalry between the Hippie van and the Army truck, or the crazy old Model T talking to the memorial of her dead husband (very touching), gives a complex and wonderfully, realistically diverse view off small town life. The same is true with the racing world. Wilson and Newman are, of course, fantastic. It\\'s funny how the gravel in Newman\\'s voice fits perfectly with the rumble of his engine, likewise Wilson\\'s distinct voice sounds just like the high-tuned growl of a race car. Every voice is so paired. Bottom line, you leave loving virtually every character in the movie.4. Story. A little bit A Christmas Carol, a little bit The Sting. The story starts out fast and exciting, like the race it portrayed. The big second act meanders lazily from one fantastic story point to the next, just like Route 66 drives from one landmark to another. I can see why some may say it can get slow, but, as is one of the points of the story, the joy is in the ride. And again, the third act flows quickly and furiously like, well, another race.I give it a score of 10 out of 10. I can\\'t wait to see it again.',\n",
       " 'To this reviewer, there are two kinds of sci fi.The common type dates back to Buck Rogers and has more modern iterations in Star Trek and Star Wars.

Consider the DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (1951/2008) or CUBE (1997) or the more recent MARTIAN (2015).The second type is an oddity because most of the heavy lifting takes place in your brain, not on the screen.I consider ARRIVAL the best example of the \"Smart\" genre ever done.These films, because they are so subjective, require a central character that the viewer can identify with.

       " \"What a disaster.... DC animation used to be the gold standard for superhero content but now it's a mere shadow of its former self. The storytelling is a convoluted mess that fails to respect its characters or the audience's time; it's unbelievable this concept got a 3 movie deal. Most of the Bat Family gets key jangled in front of you but they all come across as emotionally inept, constantly bickering during the most crucial moments of a multiversal crisis. Jensen Ackles himself delivers yet another lackluster performance. I honestly have no idea how he could sound so bored voicing Batman. Doesn't matter if it's a voice actor like Keven Conroy or a film actor like Christian Bale, they had different tones for different scenes. Ackles never diverts his pitch from sounding mildly annoyed. Unfortunately the animation itself also took a significant downgrade since their previous iteration with Jason O'Mara. It's difficult to see the characters and world you grew up loving look so bland and uninspired. Moreover when theoretically they could do absolutely anything with these characters within the multiverse concept. With everyone upping their animation game (Into the Spiderverse, TMNT, Arcane, X-Men97, Cyberpunk, etc), it's very concerning to see DC diving head first in the wrong direction.\",\n",
       " \"Shutter Island. A film that will divide the film community. A film that will leave many upset, and hating it. A film that has already completely split the critics. A movie that messes with you. And no one likes to be messed with. And that is exactly where it exceeds. Think I'm contradicting myself? Shutter Island is one of the most well crafted psychological thrillers to come by since Silence Of The Lambs. And it is no coincidence both were brilliantly written novels. Shutter Island is adapted by a book written by Dennis Lehane (wrote gone baby, gone and mystic river). It is a book filled with twists and turns, that will leave the reader dizzy. And, that is what it's film counterpart does to the fullest. Martin Scorsese helms the director chair, in a movie where he is more free than any before. This is Scorsese at his most unrestrained. Marty takes what he has learned from the great films of the past and puts it into his. The master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock's influence is everywhere you look in this film. And it is no wonder, considering Scorsese even showed one of his greatest works to the crew: Vertigo. And many of those ideas are present in Shutter Island; the cliff scenes scream Hitchcock. This is a film that creeps and crawls, and is filled with dark corners. And it is all heightened by the coming storm that looms over the island. This is classic film noir. The story follows Teddy, a federal Marshall, and his partner Chuck (Played by DiCaprio and Ruffulo). They go to this mysterious island enveloped in fog to investigate an escape. From these opening scenes, Marty has set up a dark and creepy premise. Almost the whole movie incorporates this story as Teddy desperately tries to find the truths he seeks. Teddy is shown as a scared man; a man of war and violence as portrayed in various flashbacks. These will go on to be increasingly important as the story progresses. We follow Teddy on his quest, through every dark corridor and perilous confrontations. Slowly, we are given pieces to the puzzle, but the audience does not even realize it. For we, like Teddy, are blind. For the moment at least. It is because of this that the thrilling conclusion will leave many blindsided. But, you see, that is where this thriller becomes something more. We as the audience are put in Teddy's shoes, and we feel all the things he feels. It is a complete assault on the senses, and it works beautifully. This is a film you must watch carefully. That is another thing that sets this apart, it is a horror film that makes you actually think. In this day and age, I'm not surprised some found it terrible esp. after their brains have been turned to mush by these new gore filled horror films. Scorsese's ultimate goal here is to wake you up. And trust me, you probably wont like it. This is also a film I would recommend seeing a second time. In fact, it is even better the second time. All those pieces of that puzzle you didn't catch the first time, you will the second. You see, we as the audience are first put in the shoes of Teddy. The second? Well, without giving too much away, lets just say you are put in someones else's shoes entirely during the second viewing. Shutter Island. A film that will make you question your own sanity. A film that will leave you breathless. A film that has re-ignited the thriller genre. A film that will leave you, and the main character, searching for answers. 10 out of 10 -CLS\",\n",
       " 'TOMBSTONE, one of two epic westerns about Wyatt Earp released within a few months of each other (1993-94) lacks the lyrical, \\'warts-and-all\\' quality of Kevin Costner\\'s WYATT EARP, but is a more successful film, with tighter pacing, more clearly drawn characters, and a reverence to the genre that has made it the most popular Western of the last twenty years.From the opening scene, narrated by the legendary Robert Mitchum, a nod to the great Hollywood Westerns of the past is evident; a gang of outlaws calling themselves \\'The Cowboys\\' break up a Mexican wedding in a small town, ruthlessly killing nearly all the men, including village priest Pedro Armendáriz Jr. (son of the legendary Western actor), in a scene reminiscent of ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, and THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. Led by two of Hollywood\\'s flashiest character actors, swaggering Powers Boothe, and coldly psychotic Michael Biehn (playing Johnny Ringo), the presence of such pure evil sets the stage for the Earps\\' arrival in Tombstone.A powerful cast is essential for a great Western, and you couldn\\'t find a better group of actors as the Earp brothers; Kurt Russell, chiseled, squinty-eyed, and razor-thin, is an ideal Wyatt; Sam Elliott, one of Hollywood\\'s best Western actors, plays Virgil with a growl but a twinkle in his eye; and Bill Paxton, soon to achieve stardom in APOLLO 13 and TWISTER, makes a terrific Morgan. Then there is Val Kilmer, as Doc Holliday...While Dennis Quaid, in WYATT EARP, gave the most realistic portrayal of the dying dentist-turned-gambler/gunfighter ever recorded on film (he was superb), Kilmer, relying on bloodshot eyes, an ambiguous sexuality, and a Brando-esque line delivery, literally steals TOMBSTONE, and has become the \\'Doc\\' everyone remembers. He is so charismatic that you nearly forget that the Earps are the focus of the story! Watch for his early scene confronting a shotgun-wielding (and chubby!) Billy Bob Thornton (three years before SLING BLADE), out to kill Wyatt, and you\\'ll see my point.The events leading up to the famous Gunfight at the O.K. Corral are clearly and decisively presented, from Wyatt\\'s first meeting with future wife Josie (Dana Delany), to the murder of Tombstone\\'s Marshal (Harry Carey, Jr., son of another legendary Western star, and a staple of many John Ford films), which leads to Virgil taking the badge and making his brothers (in Wyatt\\'s case, reluctantly) deputies, to the friction with Ike Clanton (GODS AND GENERALS\\' Stephen Lang) that explodes into the short but bloody shootout that became legendary.Where TOMBSTONE and WYATT EARP both excel is in presenting the aftermath of the gunfight. Unlike MY DARLING CLEMENTINE or GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL, the true story doesn\\'t tie up neatly with a happy ending at the Corral, but becomes darker and bloodier. The Earps are placed under house arrest, and after they are acquitted in court, friends of Clanton (in TOMBSTONE, Ringo and other Cowboys), cold-bloodedly murder Morgan and cripple Virgil. Wyatt explodes, and grimly sets about, with Holiday and a small band of gunmen, to execute every possible Clanton ally he can find (\"You tell him I\\'m coming! And hell\\'s coming with me!\"). Becoming a wanted fugitive himself, he only stops his mission of vengeance long enough to take the ailing Holiday to a friend\\'s cabin (Charlton Heston has a brief but memorable cameo as the rancher), but the gambler returns in time for the gunblazing climax of the film.TOMBSTONE is the kind of Western that critics love to say aren\\'t made anymore, a throwback to the golden days of Ford and Hawks, when Good and Evil were clearly defined. Director George P. Cosmatos grew up on those films, as well as those of Sergio Leone, and he said, of TOMBSTONE, that it was made to honor the Westerns he loved so much.It is his love of the Western that makes TOMBSTONE a truly superior film!',\n",

       " \"'Ready Player One (2018)' should have been called 'The Pop-Culture Movie', since it is so chock-full of blatant references and call-backs to media, from the eighties and nineties in particular. It seems as though this over-reliance on pre-existing material, along with its recognition and nostalgic value, is the driving force behind most of the narrative, being that the flick itself doesn't capture the spirit of the films it intends to ape, and so often calls out by name to cringe-worthy results, but instead shoves in reference after soulless reference in a vapid attempt to prey on its audience's ability to recognise things they've seen before. This 'nostalgia vampirism' is meant to evoke memories of better films and have those emotions transposed onto this one, though it only succeeds in the former and reminds you how much you'd rather watch any of those than this. It's evocative of the larger issues that plague the flick, those being that it doesn't have any real stakes or ability to engage on its own and also treats its audience as rather dumb and forces expository dialogue down their throats at every opportunity. The on-the-nose exposition is honesty some of the most intense and grating I've experienced in some time. The feature does have some nice visual effects and I care about the digital 'avatars' as much as any of their real-world counter-parts, though only to a certain degree, but so much is happening that it it's hard to register at times due to the odd colour palette and heavily contrasting character designs. It doesn't have a cohesive aesthetic, to say the least. It does have a good score by Alan Silvestri, though, and some of its allegorical undertones certainly ring true. It honestly doesn't entertain me, though, despite all its visual splendour and things that should appeal directly to me, and that really tells you all you need to know. For all the throw-away movie references, where is the fun of 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981)'? Where is the wonder of 'E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)', the suspense of 'Jaws (1975)' or the excitement of 'Jurassic Park (1993)'? In other words, where is Spielberg? 4/10.\",\n",

Even the space stuff, which is normally an automatic plus for me, added nothing. Maybe it\\'s missing the feel of space that good directors like Christopher Nolan are able to capture. Or maybe it\\'s because I didn\\'t care about the story or the characters even a tiny bit.Speaking of characters... what characters? They\\'re all cardboard cutouts. You have zero investment in any of them. They spew lines of atrocious dialogue that sound like they were written by a computer program.While watching this, I kept noticing different things copied from various movies. This is fine if the movie is well-made, or if the copying is just for a portion of the movie. But this movie is poorly-made, and the copying seems to make up the entire thing.And while each of the movies it stole from likely delved deep into that concept, this movie just throws it in there as an afterthought. There are so many useless side plots. These are things that could have worked if they narrowed it down and focused on a couple.This movie is really dumb. I kept trying to forgive the flaws and give it a chance, but less than halfway through I started laughing at the stupidity. I had to make sure I didn\\'t laugh too loud in case someone was enjoying it somehow.Seriously, I can\\'t emphasize how dumb this movie is. Throughout. And I don\\'t just mean the science and lack of believability, I can get past that. But very simple things like, for example, when a character tells another, \"You\\'re the only one who believed me.\" And I think to myself, \"Wait... WHAT??? He didn\\'t believe you and had security escort you off the premises.\" The movie is jam-packed with this type of nonsense.In the end, if you can\\'t, at the very least, deliver entertaining mayhem, then you have failed.

       " \"In 2009, up and coming director Neill Blomkamp won fans all over the globe with his release of District 9, a sci-fi debut for the ages that suggested we had just witnessed the arrival of a new generational talent.Fast forward to August 2023 and that very same director is back with his highest profile film in years, a glorified 2 hour plus Playstation commercial with a core cast that includes everyone's favourite Netflix sheriff/father figure and Ginger Spice.BASED ON A TRUE STORY! (In case the marketing teams message didn't quite come across in its incessant reminders to us all that this is not fantasy), Gran Turismo is one of the most inoffensive yet blandest blockbusters of the year as Blomkamp forgoes any of the creativity he showed with District 9 and his lesser sci-fi offerings Elysium and Chappie to put us in the fast lane with Archie Madekwe's Jann Mardenborough, a British gamer who left the comfort of his bedroom driving rig to enter into the very real (and very dangerous) world of organised racing.Following all the tropes in the book and delivering them in a way that makes one suspect the Playstation executives and producers of the film here may as well have sat on Blomkamp's directors chair through the whole process of this film coming to life, you almost wish that Gran Turismo was far worse in a notable way than it is here as the way in which its been bought to life makes it hard to hate with a passion, leaving it as one of those odd films that exists (for whatever reason that may be outside of hoping to sell a few extra PS5 consoles), only to be forgotten about before we've had time to contemplate its being.Reported to have a budget ranging in the $100 million dollar range, Blomkamps crowd-pleaser certainly has a shiny outer rig and it's the exact type of film that is sure to appeal to casual and less demanding of film-goers, racing fans and those that have spent hours on the tracks in the Gran Turismo franchise over the years but for anyone that likes to steer well clear of cliches, one note characters, talented cast members collecting an easy cheque or scripts that feel as though they went through more than a singular draft, Blomkamp's effort here isn't going to provide much value.With a hamstrung cast, that sadly sees the likes of David Harbour and Djimon Hounsou slumming it with roles they could play in their sleep and a hamming it up Orlando Bloom as Nissan marketing guru Danny Moore chewing scenery like its a tasty piece of candy, there was a chance that Gran Turismo's on track action could elevate the overall vibe of the feature or at least ramp up the thrills but compared to recent race-centric offerings like Ford v Ferrai or Rush, Blomkamp's film pales in comparison, unable to ever get its drama or its spectacle out of first gear.Final Say -There have been far worse video game adaptations in the history of cinema, a billion dollar effort earlier in 2023 a prime example, but there's no escaping from the fact that Gran Turismo is an instantly forgettable and entirely unimaginative crowd-pleaser that is destined to be forgotten long before the fumes have dissipated.2 Kenny G songs out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)\",\n",

       " \"Fast & Furious 9 did what a lot of franchises do at some point: it took the action into outer space. This seemed to me like a good point to call it quits. But with the money still rolling in, nobody in Hollywood was going to end this cash cow; thus we have Fast X, the first in a rumoured three part finale (until the inevitable reboot).I've been on board with the franchise since the start, sticking with it as it moved from the street racing world into more James Bond territory, the action getting more and more ridiculous with each chapter. Seeing how each movie would top the one before in terms of craziness is what kept me entertained. But Fast X is just dumb, and it's not even dumb fun.The stunts are more preposterous than ever, but the film is never thrilling, every interminable action scene enhanced by rather ropey CGI (the flames, in particular, look really bad). There are some dreadful attempts at humour (mostly courtesy of Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris), and we get all that inevitable crap about the importance of family (if I see the gang having another barbecue I think I'll hurl).And then there's Jason Momoa as villain Dante...I can see what they were going for -- kooky flamboyant psycho capable of almost anything -- but Momoa is absolutely awful, his performance bordering on camp, not helped by the character's dubious choice of attire. It's hard to find Dante menacing when he's flouncing about in a silky shirt. I'll no doubt watch the next two films for the sake of completion, but with Momoa on board it'll be hard going.Fast X is easily the weakest of the series so far, but I'll give it 3/10 because I guess things could get even worse.\",\n",

       " \"'Spirited Away' is the first Miyazaki I have seen, but from this stupendous film I can tell he is a master storyteller. A hallmark of a good storyteller is making the audience empathise or pull them into the shoes of the central character. Miyazaki does this brilliantly in 'Spirited Away'. During the first fifteen minutes we have no idea what is going on. Neither does the main character Chihiro. We discover the world as Chihiro does and it's truly amazing to watch. But Miyazaki doesn't seem to treat this world as something amazing. The world is filmed just like our workaday world would. The inhabitants of the world go about their daily business as usual as full with apathy as us normal folks. Places and buildings are not greeted by towering establishing shots and majestic music. The fact that this place is amazing doesn't seem to concern Miyazaki. What do however, are the characters. Miyazaki lingers upon the characters as if they were actors. He infixes his animated actors with such subtleties that I have never seen, even from animation giants Pixar. Twenty minutes into this film and I completely forgot these were animated characters; I started to care for them like they were living and breathing. Miyazaki treats the modest achievements of Chihiro with unashamed bombast. The uplifting scene where she cleanses the River God is accompanied by stirring music and is as exciting as watching gladiatorial combatants fight. Of course, by giving the audience developed characters to care about, the action and conflicts will always be more exciting, terrifying and uplifting than normal, generic action scenes. Through Chihiro, Miyazaki is clearly (but non-patronisingly) talking to youth of Japan. There's a certain sense of revile about the youth of Japan at the moment. Many people consider them to be ill-mannered and baring no respect for their elders or their forefathers. They are simply bi-products of their material world and consumerism. 'Spirited Away' taps into this. At the start Chihiro is a selfish, spoiled, whiny brat. But as she plunges deeper into the spirit world, she becomes more independent, more assured, more respectful and learns some manners. No Face, a black figure with a white mask, is the catalyst behind Chihiro's transformation. Once he is let into the bathhouse, we are no longer tourists \\x96 the story propels forth. Watching No Face prey on the greed of the workers is a terrifying delight. The three main characters in Miyazaki's youth allegory are Chihiro, No Face and Bô. All of these characters are disconnected with their world. They are lonely, misunderstood and largely ignored. But when they go on their journey together, they united and become stronger individuals.Miyazaki also talks about the ecology of Japan. What was once a beautiful; grassland has now turned into the Asian New York. That The Last Samurai had to be filmed in New Zealand to get a turn of the century Japanese look speaks volumes. The River God sequence is an unsubtle but unpretentious commentary on pollution. While these two themes are very much current in Japan, they are also universal themes \\x96 which makes 'Spirited Away' a universal story that most of us can connect with. I'm willing to bet everyone reading this has at some time seen bicycles lying on a lake bed or have had a child talk to them disrespectfully. Sure these themes aren't advanced philosophy. They are everyday issues told in an inventive, fun way.The animation is wonderful, if not as smooth as Disney's works \\x96 but there's something superior to that. 'Spirited Away's imperfect, but detailed world is far more fascinating than the perfected blandest of Disney's latest offerings. The animators successfully balanced the tight-rope between not-enough animation on characters and too much animation on characters. No Ralph Balski ADD antics here! The film is full of vivid images \\x96 both beautiful and horrifying. The line between those two extremes is crossed over seamlessly. From Chihiro and Haku running through an opening flower field to Haku's dragon snarling with a bloody mouth, both extremes seem to belong in the film. It's also excellently done with the characters. Kamaji can be seen as a scary, daunting figure at the beginning, but soon he seamlessly changes into a humble, wise figure. Yubaba also seems to be able to turn from kind to witch with the snap of a finger. The sound on the film was expertly done. The sounds perfectly match the on screen actions and objects. My sub woofer got a wonderful workout when Haku swoops Chihiro past the bridge at the beginning. And while I don't speak Japanese, I think the voice actors did a wonderful job of conveying their personality and emotions true their voice. Joe Hisaishi's music is sublime, definitely one of my favourite scores. His main piano theme is simple and evocative. His thunderous action music hits the viewers on the chest like a hammer. Like all great scores it heightens the greatness of a scene about three times. The score, unlike many American composers', is unobtrusive. It plays excellently with the scenes, but never overbears them. A lot of the time the it is barely noticeable, a sole piano plays softly in the background evoking a dreamlike/lullaby quality. 'Spirited Away' is a simply a modern masterpiece, easily one of the Top 10 films of the new millennium. It works on a multitude of levels; a social commentary on Japan, a homage to ancient Japanese/Russian mythology, a moral film for both children and adults. But most importantly, it is a simple story brilliantly told by a great filmmaker who appears to be at the top of his game. 'Spirited Away' works much like a relaxing journey. Pop in the DVD; leave this world for two hours and when you will be almost certainly enriched and ready to take the trip again.\",\n",
       " \"This movie was insane!After being legitimately scared watching Runga's previous film Atterados, I knew that his follow up would up the ante and be even more brutal without shying away from what other directors wouldn't even attempt to show, but even I was shocked at the brutality shown in this film. I mean, was it too much? Some of the scenes were jaw dropping. I've honestly never seen some of the stuff shown in this movie EVER in my 30+ years as a fan of horror movies, and I hope they go over well with the majority of the audience as this new bar that was set and raised simultaneously is extremely high.If you think this a run of the mill demonic possession film, you would be sorely mistaken. There are no catholic priests or churches, no crosses or holy water, no head spinning or contortions (there is a little pea soup, but that's just because it's the easiest thing to feed someone who is comatose). There are no catholic demonic possession tropes to be found in this film, which is a HUGE breath of fresh air for one of the stalest subgenres in horror. It's a movie about demons possessing people like a virus, and they have their own set of rules as to how they are dealt with, and a very specific way of expelling them. Honestly, it's this type of fresh and novel approach to film making that makes Runga a standout where other movies seemed to fail so miserably (I'm looking at you, Exorcist; Believer). If more writers/directors took the time to take horror staples and twist them to make an original and unique creation, we would have a more vibrant and rich selection of horror movies.The standout of this film aside from the superb acting and the terrifying score, was the carnage and gore (as in, the use of practical special effects over CGI). It all looked so REAL. That scene with the dog was absolutely monstrous, and I shook my head in disbelief that anyone would have the gonads to show something that intense in a film. The movie rarely lets up, and you will be treated to jaw drop after jaw drop. Really, it's a spectacle, and one that is best shared with others just to see and hear their reactions.Overall, I couldn't recommend this film more if I tried. It's beautifully shot, well acted, the horror is intense and gore hounds will be pleased. It's original, it's fresh, it's dread induced as all get out. It's just a treat of a horror film and I urge anyone who loves the genre to see this movie. It deserves all of the success it will undoubtedly receive.\",\n",
       " \"After gaving us some of the greatest epic movies in the last 50 years,it was clear that filmmakers needed to take them to the next level. But how can you make a new movie,for the audience to like,without recycling old material? Answer:You improve what old filmmakers couldn't:Graphics. Ben Hur,Braveheart,Gladiator,Spartacus and perhaps even Troy are only some of the epic movies that gave the audience so big thrills that they cannot be repeated. Almost every epic movie that will be made today,no matter how good the story will be or how faithful will be to reality,is bound to repeat itself.We got examples from Alexander and Kingdom of Heaven. 300 doesn't apply to this category.Besides it takes the epic to the next level.And more are like to follow. Just like in the Lord of the Rings,much CGI was used here. The result? This movie was a pleasure for the eye. All the camera work and graphics exceeded my expectations. I thought they were comparable,if not better,to the LOTR,go see for yourselves.I could write something about the plot or the actors's outstanding performances(especially Gerard Butler's..you see,being Greek-Italian,I wanted the best from the actors..Butler gave it. The anger in his eyes,the fury in his voice and the violence in his actions really reminded an ancient Greek king),but I won't ruin it for you. You must see it to understand how great this movie is.But always remember that this is a movie that is based on a graphic novel and is by no means a faithful depiction of what really happened in Thermopylae in 480 B.C. All those who will pay the ticket to see this movie,must be prepared not for a historic movie,but for a stylish battle movie. This movie,together with the LOTR,is the entrance to the 21st century's new epic movies. Kudos to Zack Snyder,who came from nowhere and has,already from Dawn of the Dead,proved that he is a brilliant and capable director. We will surely see more of him in the upcoming years.So,you read my Comment?Aren't you curious? What are you waiting for?Run to the nearest cinema,see this piece of art and when you are finished don't forget to come to IMDb to vote. This movie is destined to be at least in the top 100.C'mon people!Hail for 300,the Evolution of Epic Battles!\",\n",
       " 'Having seen the trailers for this film I have to say that I didn\\'t walk into the cinema with high hopes. The computer effects looked badly integrated, the Green Goblin\\'s costume looked awful and comic book adaptations usually have such painful scripting and plotting. Thankfully I was wrong on most counts (The Goblin still looks rubbish).As it turns out, this is probably the best super-hero film I\\'ve yet seen - certainly up there with Superman and Batman. People seem to automatically comment that the script and acting was bad because they expect it to be the case in these films; and indeed it usually is. But if you go into Spider-man without this prejudicial attitude you\\'ll be pleasently suprised. The acting is generally great - there is never a time when anyone is not believable as their character and you think \"Hey, that\\'s an actor, not Peter Parker\". The effects do look artificial but the pace of the movie means you don\\'t have time to dwell on this and the script is fine! What do people want, Shakespearian soliloquies? That would sound incredibly out-of-place in modern day New York. There are few of the painful cliches or dreadful dialogue that plague films like The Phantom Menace and the catchphrases like \"friendly neighbourhood spider-man\" are fully in-keeping with the character.\\nThe comic turns from J.J. Jameson hit the mark, the snarling facial contortions of Willem Defoe were suitably evil-looking (and the conversation with his mirror-image was a great touch). My only gripe was with the Green Goblin\\'s costume. Very monotone green and not very scary.All-in-all a great film that I wouldn\\'t hesitate for a second in recommending.',\n",
       " 'This is truly one of the greatest science fiction films ever made, one that requires a thinking viewer in order to understand and appreciate it.  The director\\'s cut is the recommended one to see as it omits a somewhat distracting narration and avoids an unnecessary Hollywood-style ending that is at odds with the rest of the film\\'s tone.A true science fiction story or film is about ideas, not spaceship battles, futuristic gadgets, or weird creatures.  \"Blade Runner\" fully qualifies as this in its examination of the impact of technology on human society, existence, and the very nature of humanity itself.  These themes are set in a fairly basic detective story that moves slowly but gradually builds power as the viewer is immersed in a dystopian futuristic Los Angeles.Harrison Ford fans accustomed to the normally dynamic roles that he plays may be dissatisfied with the seemingly lifeless lead character that he portrays here as the replicant-hunting detective known as a \"blade runner\". They should be, for this dissatisfaction is part of the film experience, part of the dehumanized existence in the story\\'s setting.  However, as the story unfolds, we see Ford\\'s character, Rick Deckard, slowly come alive again and recover some humanity while pursing four escaped replicants.The replicants, genetically-engineered human cyborgs, that Deckard must hunt down and kill are in many ways more alive than Deckard himself initially. Their escape from an off-world colony has an explicit self-directed purpose, whereas Deckard\\'s life appears to have none other than his job, one that he has tried to give up.  By some standards, Deckard and the replicants have thin character development.  However, this is a deeply thematic and philosophical film, and as such the characters are the tools of the story\\'s themes.  Each character reflects some aspect of humanity or human existence, but they lack others, for each is broken in ways that reflect the broken society in which they live and were conceived/created.There are several dramatic moments involving life-and-death struggles, but most of these are more subdued than in a normal detective story plot.  The film\\'s power is chiefly derived through its stunning visual imagery of a dark futuristic cityscape and its philosophical themes.Among the themes explored are the following: - The dehumanization of people through a society shaped by technological and capitalistic excess. - The roles of creator and creation, their mutual enslavement, and their role reversal, i.e., the creation\\'s triumph over its creator. - The nature of humanity itself: emotions, memory, purpose, desire, cruelty, technological mastery of environment and universe, mortality, death, and more. - Personal identity and self-awareness. - The meaning of existence.If you are not someone who naturally enjoys contemplating such themes, the film\\'s brilliance may be lost on you.  The climax involves a soliloquy that brings many of the themes together in a simple yet wonderfully poetic way. Anyone who \"gets\" the film should be moved by this; others will sadly miss the point and may prefer watching some mindless action flick instead.\"Blade Runner\" is a masterpiece that deserves recognition and long remembrance in film history.',\n",
       " \"I haven't read the book, so I can't say anything about it, but everything in the plot is predictable and obvious since the beginning, scene by scene, the acting is unbelievable bad, sooooo bad I'm actually shocked they made it to the final cut, the actors have no diction in Italian and everything is constantly whispered, the lead female actress just can't act, she was the worst, followed by the lead male actor (who is a singer, so I understand why acting is not his strength), the director's choices are nonsense in every scene, the script and the lines are so terrible that you end up giggling and wondering. At one point new characters are introduced and you don't know who they are until the end of the scene. There is one scene (no spoiler because it's useless to the plot) where the parents are stuck in the traffic and it's evening. When the traffic is over and the parents are back home, it's morning and everyone is cool with that and having spent the night in the car waiting for the cars to move.

       " \"I am obviously going against the trend here, so be it. I found the movie pretentious, ill balanced and with none of the nuances other more accomplished directors manage to reveal with their use of absurdism and counterpoint.First, if the movie had been short, maybe it would have been bearable, maybe, as it stands, its length goes to show, at least for me, that there was not a compass that guided the director, this was a rudderless attempt at social commentary. I don't care if Mr Lanthimos is considered the plus ultra of directors, this is bad.The movie tries to match absurdism with social commentary, but fails to create a world in which A) the absurd seems plausible and B) the plausible seems absurd. The deadpan, flat delivery of the lines loses all power after the first 30 minutes of the 1h 58m this thing goes on for and the humour, again, always spurred on by the absurdity of the moment/comment/observation, fails to find me (as it failed to find the funny bone of most people in a packed, large movie theatre in London, in fact, first movie I've gone to see in ages where people began to leave the cinema half-way, which I longingly followed with my eyes wishing it was me).The cinematography is fine, nothing out of the ordinary, but Lanthimos fails to use it to punctuate the absurd moments (something Wes Anderson does very well, as does Paolo Sorrentino) nor is the dramatism enhanced by precise camera work (Hitchcock, Fellini, Truffaut). The dialogue, even in its supposed absurdist nature, is poor, fails to weave across and is uneven. While the leads do a super job, the characters are flat and I don't care for them or what happens to them, which is always a bad sign for me.There are moments when this thing is good, like the hotel managers singing a duet, but they do not translate across the whole story, mainly because very quickly we leave the only part where there are interesting characters and spend the rest of the movie in the forest. I found the movie:-Too long -Pretentious without the grace to be so -flat -Uninspiring -did I say too long? -A convoluted way to tell a story that could have been told with the same intent in less time, with more observant, astute dialogue and far better crafted cinematography -A depressing experience -Not funny, by milesHaving just seen for the first time 'The Great Beauty' followed by 'The Royal Tenenbaums' I realized now what The 'Lobster' could have been but did not have the artistic currency to do. The social commentary is there, no doubt, I just did not like how it was executed.Maybe I am just a heathen with no taste...but of course, these are my impressions, I know others who truly loved it, and that is good too.\",\n",

Ahh he must have been put there as a religious ceremony and this is probably the beginning of religion.If they have better reasons to why the jumped si high for these conclusions, they didn't explain them.Also, i found the reenactments cringey, and the pacing is off.

For those of you who have seen Batman Begins, his character was much scarier in this film. He played his character very well. The scariest \"bad guy,\" I have seen in awhile. Rachel McAdams was great. Everyone in the audience laughed, gasped and cheered at the same time, as if we were on cue. The suspense is held through out the movie. THe amazing part is that the end was not anti-climatic. I was not disappointed in the end. I felt satisfied. The trailer does not do the movie justice.

Although, I did not have to pay to see this movie, I would have gladly given 10.75 to see it. Enjoy!',\n",
       " 'Very underrated modernization of the classic Shakespeare play.  This movie has been pretty heavily criticized for the directors outlandishness in cinematography, but he understands when to tone down the often frantic pace of the storytelling during the dramatic scenes, and in fact this relationship tends to amplify their potency. Beautifully choreographed and shot, wonderfully acted by both the supporting cast and the main 2 stars, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, and extremely sly modernization techniques to the dialogue.  All the elizabethan dialogue remains intact, yet it all seems coherent in the modern atmosphere. mostly due to good imagery and double meaning in the phrases (ex: their swords being a gun model, or the flash of money while quoting gold.).  One of the best shakespeare adaptations in the multitude of which have entered the cinemas in the past few years.',\n",
       " 'After being disappointed with Age of Extinction, loathing The Last Knight, and being one of the few that disliked Bumblebee, I went into this movie expecting it to be terrible. But I am ecstatic after watching the best Transformers movie since Dark of the Moon.I found myself smiling for most of the runtime. For the first time in years, I kept thinking \"Transformers are so damn cool.\" There are so many beautiful shots with these CGI creations, so many moments to screenshot and frame. The action is miles better than the last three entries.They fixed so many of the issues that plagued the last three movies. There are actual characters with motivations we understand, conflicts where we can see both sides of the argument. Even the Transformer characters are significantly more fleshed out. I felt for them.There is an actual story instead of nonsense to move the plot forward. You don\\'t even have to turn your brain off to enjoy it. And the comedy actually works! I laughed more times than the previous three movies combined.This experience made me so happy, and I look forward to any future projects if this is the direction they\\'re taking. It\\'s a perfect example of how, if you do it right and create with care and passion, the result will be endlessly better.EDIT: I loved it even more the second time. Multiple action sequences give me goosebumps, similar to how I feel when watching the Dark of the Moon highway scene and the Optimus rage scene at the end. And I can\\'t believe I didn\\'t mention it originally, but the musical score is AMAZING.

       " \"The Flash is a goofy movie. Not only is it much lighter in tone than most of the DC Extended Universe, but it's also wildly uneven, unsuccessfully trying to balance dramatic moments with constant attempts at lowbrow humor. The computer graphics are shockingly bad and are, at times, reminiscent of 2004's The Polar Express. There are some genuinely dramatic parts, when Ezra Miller isn't mugging for the camera, and I'd be lying if I said my childhood heart didn't surge with joy almost every time a Tim Burton's Batman reference was made, but The Flash was, for the most part, a disappointing fizzle.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m sitting here trying to come up with a clever comment about this movie to make you want to see it. When in reality it doesn\\'t matter what I say. As Stallone would say \"I\\'m at least half a bum.\" The truth to it is, it kind of makes me sad that I\\'ll probably never see another movie that affects so much. Never experience a film that 6 years after it\\'s release, I still can not forget.To say the most, it\\'s a powerful film. The directing is world class. The camera work is haunting and the soundtrack gives me chills. It\\'s Cruise at his finest. He is so convincing that one might actually believe that this guy is Doctor Bill Harford and this really did happen to him. And that my friends is the definition of acting. The seriousness of the situation fades away with a stern smile as the plot thickens.To say the least it is one of those movies you could watch over and over again. To be honest with you, I didn\\'t buy it the first time I saw it. I thought it was good, but not great. Then one day I was bored, so I decided to see it again. And that\\'s when it happened. Kubrick came alive. I became infected by his genius and captivated by Cruise\\'s portrayal. His realization and his detail.It\\'s hard to pick my favorite scene in the movie. I couldn\\'t pretend if I tried. I particularly love the opening party scene. That leads to a \"Baby did a bad bad thing\". Cruise being assaulted on the street being so eloquently called a fag. The prostitute. From the piano bar to the costume shop. And finally, the unionized orgy party, that I find hard to believe doesn\\'t really exist. Maybe only guys like Kubrick or Cruise will ever really know if they do or not.Many people might disagree with me when I say Eyes Wide Shut is one of the greatest films. But how come I think it is every time I watch it? To me, it\\'s more than a beautiful work of art. More than a visceral painted picture or a haunting melody. It\\'s a masterpiece that should be treasured.',\n",
       " 'I find it hard to comment on this film without simply repeating what has already been said. It\\'s not that I can\\'t think of anything original, but that others seem to have felt the exact same emotions as I did when watching this film.I saw this movie when I was about 12, 13, maybe 14 years old. So it didn\\'t have the same nostalgic sense it had for so many. But what it did, was make me ache for those memories. I wanted (in the words of another reviewer) to be 12, and *that* cool. I wished I had been like that, that I had had friends like that, laughed like that, and had adventures like that.The \\'milk-money\\' scene was probably one of my all-time favourite scenes in movie history. Up until I saw this movie I had never held much regard for River Phoenix, but the poignancy and sincerity which River added to the role of Chris Chambers touched me to the point of tears. I read in yet another review that in this scene, River was asked to think of a time when he had been hurt by an adult, and that even after the cameras stopped rolling, River sat there still, sobbing and hurting. And I felt every tear and heard every word as though I were there with Chris.This movie made me laugh, cry, rejoice and fear with Chris, Gordie, Teddy and Vern. I loved the campfire scenes, and today I look back on my own childhood, and remember with a laugh the amazingly similar things I used to laugh and wonder about with my friends. I remember dreaming about being a writer and an actress, I remember standing up to bullies, I remember walking or riding with my friends, I remember being afraid, and crying onto a friend\\'s shoulder.I guess what this movie does for everyone, is take them back in time, even though the situations may have been different, chances are you\\'ll find the similarities, and remember with a smile that yes, your life was once *that* cool. In the words of Vern, \"a great time\"I especially loved the ending. That they found out who was strong, and who just talked tough. I loved the last scene with Chris and Gordie, and the closing monologue.\"I never had any friends later on, like the ones I had when I was twelve...Jesus....does anyone?\"',\n",

A downright psychedelic firework display that, on the one hand, has one or two surprises also for the adult filmgoers in the subtext, but also in the spoken jokes. Ironically, these were the parts where the kids laughed the loudest, which I can't really explain.There's nothing about the plot here - because, being honest, there's hardly anything you could really call a plot. Trolls on a rescue mission, but in the end it's just colorful, loud with a lot of music, singing and dancing, with music that wanders through the pop culture of the last 50 years and yet makes it its own in a completely new way.Adults will either love or hate this film.

This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You don't need to know anymore.The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.

There's also the predictable and at the same time unbelievable rising of a new culinary talent: a poor little girl who's not mature enough to appreciate some delicacies, but is somehow capable of guessing all the ingredients in a complex sauce from just one sip. With every scene I was like: nooo, you didn't actually make this movie! Nooo! But they did.

I didn\\'t read the book and I assumed, based on the fact that this is a virtually an all-female cast, that this was some sort of chick flick. Boy, was I wrong! This is an incredible film that not only pays justice to the bestseller on which it\\'s based (according to those who have read the book AND seen the film), but is phenomenally cast, with exceptional performances by Viola Davis, Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer, Bryce Dallas Howard and Allison Janney. Veteran actresses Sissy Spacek and Cicely Tyson also deliver incredible performances. While Tyson\\'s character is central to the storyline, her role comprises what seems to be a few, precious minutes of the 2:20 running time, she delivers, in my opinion, one of the most powerful and moving moments in the film...one in which she doesn\\'t even utter a line (trust me, you\\'ll know when you see it.)The Help also delivers some very funny moments and will make you laugh. I\\'ll go so far as to say that this film and a few of its cast members will draw some Oscar nominations.

The stoies are well-told, and at times, funny, and at others, brutally shocking.The cinematic style of the film gives a nod to Tarantino, with some clever time-jumping, freeze-framing, and texts indicating another chapter of the film.

So is the skillful editing, and often original cinematographic style. This time however, it all looks somewhat slicker and better funded, and alongside the British regulars are the odd American celebrity (Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro).Everyone in the film puts in an excellent performance, but Pitt stands out as a charismatic and near-incomprehensible Gypsy boxer.Like Ritchie\\'s earlier film, this one takes a little while to find its feet, but once it does the pace doesn\\'t slacken until the finale.

He\\'s low key but violent, as he was in Mr. Deeds, Punch-Drunk Love and a few other films.Here, Sander is even more vocal and violent than normal and definitely more crude, which is saying something since this actor usually doesn\\'t play guys with a lot of class. \"Happy\" is a hot-tempered hockey player who can hit a golf ball 400 yards so he tries his hand on the PGA tour to help raise money for his grandmother. I just shake my head even writing that last sentence, it sounds so stupid....but this is a stupid movie with an incredibly stupid story but is hilarious, for the most part.Anyone who is a golfer would appreciate this movie more than others, because Sandler says and does things we\\'d all like to do on the links at times but, thankfully, don\\'t. In short: this is a crude but very funny movie.',\n",
       " '\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is on my top 10 list of all-time favorite movie. I did not feel that \"Dial of Destiny\" gave a proper send off to the francise. It seemed like the first half of the movie is nothing but over the top chase scenes about trying to get possession of the Dial. That first half does not invest time to plant motivation so the viewer will even care about the Dial and who gets possession of it. Also, the Helena character is pretty unlikeable. Her passion is in the wrong place. Indiana is at odds with Helena for most of the movie. They do not make a good team. And then Indiana is a deflated version of Indiana that is kind of depressing. And to top it all off, there is no sense of fun and comedy in the movie. I hope writers have not forgotten how to write a good adventure story. \"Dial of Destiny\" misses the mark on many levels. And it kind of bothered me how much unnecessary killing there was in the movie. That is not family friendly. I wanted to really like \"Dial of Destiny\", but as the movie was progressing, I had to admit the movie was just not working.',\n",
       " \"This is the best rendition of Dracula ever captured on film. Gary Oldman's dark and sensual personae outshines any other vampire who ever dare put on a cape. To me Gary Oldman is the most talented and underrated actor ever. He becomes who he is playing, however in this role... Dracula became him... Oldman set the bar so high it is untouchable even to Bela Lugosi. Winona Ryder's delicateness suited the role of Mina/Elisabeta nicely and Keanu Reeves played the unsuspecting and naive Jonathan with satisfaction. However the whole movie comes together because of Gary Oldman's intoxicating essence. He draws the viewers into his darkness and passion and guides them through until the end. This film is drastically romantic and hauntingly captivating- just like a real Dracula movie should be. The cinematography deserved Oldman's phenomenal performance and perfectly created a true vampire realm. Francis Ford Coppola is brilliant. This is the spirit of the vampire.\",\n",
       " \"And drive he does as Michael Bay translates the Transformers world of animation and toys to the big screen.But before I get ahead of myself I have to admit I never watched even a single episode growing up. I had just hit high school and I wasn't interested. So there wasn't any real baggage involved either side of the coin.Yet there I sat in the first public screening anywhere on the planet (June 12th in Sydney, Australia, with Michael Bay introducing it) and it just overwhelmed me and everyone else! There was never a dull moment, the script flowed easily, the acting was first-rate and the seamlessness of the CGI and live action was taken to another level.It's going to be the hit of the summer and was better than any of the big third installment trilogies I have just also seen. And I love each of those franchises.Congratulations on a movie that not only met expectations but exceeded them.\",\n",
       " 'Many people compare \"Once Upon a Time in America\" with \"The Godfather\". In my opinion these two movies can\\'t be compared. Both are masterpieces in their own way, but each of them has a different style. You don\\'t compare a Picasso to Michelangelo\\'s Sixteen Chapel either, do you?What is it that makes this movie a masterpiece? Well, first of all there is the director. Sergio Leone is a real master when it comes to creating a special atmosphere, full of mystery, surprises and drama... He\\'s one of the few directors who understands the art of cutting a movie in such a way that you stay focused until the end. The way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don\\'t think this movie is very special. There are three versions, but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn\\'t want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910\\'s - 1930\\'s - 1960\\'s), but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order, loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it, you have to make sure you get the director\\'s cut. The second reason why this movie is so great is the music. Ennio Morricone, who is seen as the greatest writer of film music ever, did an excellent job. Together with the images, the music speaks for itself in this movie. From time to time there isn\\'t said a word, but the music and the images on their own tell the story. He understood perfectly what Sergio Leone wanted and composed most of the music even before the movie was shot.Last but not least there is also the acting and the script. The actors all did an excellent job. But what else can you expect from actors like Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci... They helped making this movie as great as it is by putting there best effort in it. The script helped them with it. It took twelve years to complete, but it hasn\\'t left any detail untouched. The writers really thought of everything when creating it.I can really recommend this movie to everyone, but especially to people who like the gangster genre. When you want to see the movie, you better be sure that you will have the time for it. This isn\\'t a movie that is finished after 90 minutes. You\\'ll have to be able to stay focused during 3 hours and 47 minutes, which will certainly not be easy during the first 20 to 30 minutes. Some scenes at the beginning only make sense when you have seen the end of the movie. But when you are able to stay focused, you\\'ll find this one of the best movies you\\'ve ever seen. I certainly did and I rewarded it with a well deserved 10/10.',\n",
       " 'Once again a tremendous spectacle, served with a bunch of very fine actors (\"la fine fleur\" of French actors) in all their glory, who make most of the scenes of the movie a tasty delight to savour... In particular the highly charismatic Eva Green and François Civil, who both have this magnetic presence that makes you wanna follow each of their adventures (each of the moments they share is captivating)...The staging and overall design of the movie is as majestic pleasing as in the First Part (both movies were shot at the same time) with very gorgeous framings and lightings (wonderfully mastered)... The action and stunts do the job (in spite of this recurring shaky camera), with a few cool bits (hats off to the final confrontation).Of course the stakes -even if already pretty high at some point in the First Part- are even higher here... Numerous events in this Second Part mirror events recounted in the First Part ; the situation is pretty tight for the main players, and the whole -mysterious- intrigue gets thicker and tastier as it evolves... With Milady playing a pivotal role in everything ; even when she is not here, her shadow never is very far... But things, during the entire movie, don\\'t really go as expected, twists after twists...In the end, this two-parter story definitely is a pretty gem in the long history of French Cinema, because it shows the nice will to produce a pleasing cinematic piece, à la française ; but in a fashion that uses some of the welcome contempory/modern tools.A fine and tasty adventure to watch, and potentially a Third Part to come (?)',\n",
       " 'I first read \\'Alive\\' at age 10. Yeah, probably too young considering its heavy subject matter. That book changed my life, Straight-up SAVED my life. I\\'ve read that book at least 15 times over the years, I knew all the names, all the faces in the black and white photos in that winter wasteland. And of course when we read we imagine, we put our own visuals into our minds that best fit the narrative as we understand it thru the text on a page. The tragedy, the desperation, and the horror is what stands out at face value, and it IS a horrific story, but unfortunately most people know this story due to the consumption of human flesh to survive, but I assure you, this is NOT what this story is about and it never has been. The truth is the story of The Survivors of the Andes is a love story, the love for family, the love for friends, the love for life. The story of \\'Alive\\' isn\\'t about death, so make no mistake. And at my lowest points, when I thought all was lost, this is the story that would creep into my mind, and I would imagine (there\\'s that word again: IMAGINE) what it must\\'ve been like to be on the side of that mountain, on that glacier, in that real-life scenario having to eat my dead friends as I freeze, knowing I\\'m starving to death, watching my brothers starve to death, dying from their injuries, freezing 13,000\\' up in the Andes and no one is looking for you, you know the search has been called off. ... and I\\'m trying to IMAGINE that, to visualize that, because REAL people lived this, experienced this, and its almost too much to comprehend, to visualize and IMAGINE what that was like, not only the outward visual, what you see with your eyes, the plane, the mountain, the scene, but also the emotion of that experience. How do you really ever understand the emotional aspect of such a terrible tragedy? The EMOTION involved in such desperate times. That\\'s key here. How do you imagine that? You can\\'t really, if you didn\\'t experience it.Imagine...\\nIn 1993, 19 years after I first read the book, Frank Marshall released his version of Alive in film form, with Ethan Hawke and I was beyond excited... but it failed to capture the emotion of the story, and for me, it pretty much failed in all aspects. A Hollywood-ized version of the book. A complete let down. If you haven\\'t seen it, don\\'t bother, I think it kinda sucks. It didn\\'t capture what I had IMAGINED. It fell flat in my opinion but that was as good as it gets.Even on the edge of life and death, the part of the story that ALWAYS really stood out to me was in the midst of all that sorrow and pain, physical and mental, the survivors never lost sight of the natural beauty that surrounded their crashed plane, their Home in Hell... the majesty of those mountains, with its sharp black rocks the size of buildings reaching to the heavens. It was a sight I NEEDED to see with my own eyes, I needed to stand in person where that plane had come to a stop, broken and twisted. I needed to see what they saw. I needed to sleep there for a night just to experience 0.0001% of the story of \\'Alive.\\' If there was ONE place on Earth I needed to visit, it was the Valley of Tears in Argentina, high up in the Andes, one of the most remote places on the planet.So I did in January 2016.It is probably the most miserable night of my life. Cold, windy, hard to breathe because of the altitude, couldn\\'t sleep for more than a half-hour at a clip and I wouldn\\'t change it for the world. It was here, on this trip to South America, where I (we) met Alive Survivor Eduardo Strauch Urioste. He was part of the trip, part of our group, he accompanied us from the start in Mendoza, 12 of us in total. And as we stood as a group on that hallowed ground where the crashed plane once rested I was able to see that majesty of those mountains, that 2000\\' headwall to the west, the elongated rectangular \\'famous rock\\' in the photos behind the plane. I was able to see the thousands of stars in the sky at night, not hampered by the lights of civilization, the glow of the endless snow in a location shrouded in blackness. And even then I would try to imagine the airplane, the conversations of the survivors, the sickening dread of being the last man alive, the sole survivor, possibly losing all sanity until he, too, is gone to the elements, forever nothing more than a memory.Imagine...\\nYou cannot, I could not, even spending time in that exact location with a MAN WHO LIVED IT, who encouraged the questions from a bunch of strangers, nothing off limits, because one doesn\\'t go to this place on a whim, you go to this place because it draws you there, it invades your mind, invades your heart. It won\\'t let go, and it pulls you there. We all had our demons that led us to this place. Its a place of Salvation. It calls you in, yet I still could not truly imagine, envision, the reality of those 72 days in 1972.Imagine...\\nAnd then, after waiting for 48 years -- yes, 48 YEARS -- since I read that book as a boy, Director J. A. Bayona delivers the film \\'Society of the Snow\\' and I no longer have to try to imagine, as I\\'ve now seen it, on film, on a big theater screen. AND IT IS INTENSE. Unlike the first 1993 film, this film has character development prior to boarding the ill-fated Flt 571, and it includes everyone, survivors and deceased, as it should.Okay, the plane crash itself: you won\\'t find a more horrific one on film. I remember my knees actually shaking when the pilot is trying to pull up, the sound of the roaring engines, the fear on the faces of the actors, the passengers... and then impact, and no imagining in the world lives up to this scene in the movie. Horrifyingly real from both outside and inside the plane. ... The accuracy of the crashed plane itself is almost exact, if not totally exact (I put pics of the real plane against the movie plane and it is ASTONSHING how accurate that crashed movie plane is to the real thing). I no longer have to imagine what it looked like, in motion, as if I were walking around it, because this film does that for us. I bring this up first because of course the airplane plays a central role and is the one central material object. In fact, the detail of this entire film is accurate, down to their clothing, sunglasses...\\nAnd of course that leads to the mountains, because if you saw the \\'93 film you would know that didn\\'t look anything like the real place, it looked like the Canadian Rockies, because they were. Not this movie: what you see onscreen IS the real location where this story takes place. Everything you see in those mountains surrounding that plane is the real place. You want realism, accuracy? Well, Society of the Snow delivers this with perfect detail.Make-up: If this film doesn\\'t win awards for make-up, someone on the Awards Board needs to be fired. This isn\\'t \"I\\'m Ethan Hawke and I won\\'t grow a beard\" bs. These actors literally look like they\\'ve been starving on the side of a mountain, their faces burned by the sun, the blistered lips, the filth from being stranded for two months, the injuries sustained in the crash. This is not a bloody gory film, nor does it need to be, but you do not doubt that these men have been stranded for over two months. The realism, again, leaves little to imagine, and that\\'s why we\\'re at this movie, right? To live this story as close as we can for those of us who were not there. Cinematography: The Andes are HUGE and this film captures the immense size of these mountains, this location, the distances so vast, so far. And I\\'ve been there so I can say on the big screen it does what is intended, to show the size and remoteness of these mountains, with that little unseen spec of a plane lost and invisible in the glaring white of snow and ice. Another thing the cinematography captures well is temperature. This isn\\'t a little snow machine the film crew used, but instead you FEEL the cold, you feel the frozen nights, you feel the wind. You FEEL the SUFFERING of what you see on the screen. And in my mind probably the most important part of this film: you get to see the emotion behind the consumption of the bodies, the inner battle they had to face together, the pain of the situation that drove them to do the unthinkable, but as Nando Parrado once said in a documentary \"The human brain will elevate you to heights you didn\\'t believe were possible to survive. Had you been there you would have been one of us, doing what we did.\" No less truth has ever been spoken. This is of course a hard decision, but to see it played out with such competent actors on a crashed plane set that is an exact copy of the real thing, with the expressions of the fear of this act, and the revulsion, cannot be denied. This movie does not bring in the camera to the see the use of the knife, nor should it out of respect to all involved, families of the deceased, and the film doesn\\'t need to. You know what is going on from afar, and I\\'m glad there is no sensationalism of this part of the story, but based in truth, and the actors really pull this off well, we feel for them, we see their pain in what they MUST do to survive and it is heart-wrenching.No more imagining, THIS IS the film I\\'ve waited 48 years to see. 10 Stars. A-Plus and All That. Sorrow, Joy, and everything in between. You don\\'t leave this film without it having an impact on you. It\\'s not fiction.',\n",
       " 'A bit of background about me- the person who writes this review.I have been attending the Toronto Film Festival for about 30 years. I like \"festival\"-type films: the \"artsy\" ones, the multilayered ones, the slow ones (within limits). I admire (most of) Japanese cinema and I have seen (and enjoyed) many Japanese films.Having said all that, this film is totally snobbish nonsense. Starting with the title (that has little to do with what is going on there), continuing with loooooong scenes where a fellow chops wood and carries water to a SUV and ending with - well - the final images - nothing has any rhyme or reason.I was looking forward to this film as it was advertised as having an ecological theme, but, if anything, it does the ecological movement a great disservice: it portrays the ecologists (and their movement) as a bunch of weirdos.I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 because somewhere in the film it explains where a septic tank should and should not be placed. (I learned something)(To add insult to injury, at TIFF, the film was \"presented\" by a young lady who was (mis)reading form a slip of paper a text that she did not write and had no idea what it meant.)',\n",
       " '\"Scarface\" has a major cult following even now, 22 years after its release.It has also been widely criticized as being very tacky, unrefined, over-the-top and all bloated up! These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies. It is true that on the technical front, (cinematography, screenplay, direction, etc.) Scarface is way behind \\'The Godfather\\'.But it is also true, that what Scarface has and some other gangster movies lack, is the rawness, the sheer crude approach of the gangsters. The Latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other gangster classics like \\'The Godfather\\' or \\'Goodfellas\\'. This is one of the major winning points of Scarface and I strongly believe that this fact has been written off as \"tackiness\" by most critics! I have seen the original 1932 Scarface, and I must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the \"remake\"! Al Pacino has been criticized to be over-the-top and loud in this movie. But how about considering that that is precisely the way the film-makers wanted Tony Montana\\'s character to be! He is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute! He is not the calm Michael Corleone here. He is Tony Montana, a very tacky, uneducated individual who doesn\\'t really think much and gets angry all the time!There is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs, including \\'Gina and Elvira\\'s theme\\', \\'Push it to the limit\\' and the title track instrumental.There are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, the Rebenga hit, the first meeting with Sosa and Tony\\'s visit to his mother\\'s.About the performances: Al Pacino is brilliant as the angry Cuban refugee. He has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana the most in his entire career. And it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes! One wonders what \"Scarface\" would be like without Pacino. I just couldn\\'t imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana and in all probabilities, the film wouldn\\'t be as effective without him!Steven Bauer shines as Tony\\'s friend Manny.Robert Loggia is wonderful as Tony\\'s boss, Lopez. So is F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role.Then there is some eye-candy in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and is adequate in her role.The director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax. Without revealing anything, I would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling.\"Scarface\" is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out. Enjoy it for what it is: a raw portrayal of the Drug Lords and their gangland!',\n",
       " 'Priscilla takes the spotlight instead of Elvis in this one. It had that retro aesthetic, but it was portrayed differently from the 50s/60s in Baz Luhrmann\\'s \\'Elvis.\\' This film had a more understated, even slightly gloomy vibe in comparison. Andrew just like the visuals, we get a quieter look at the relationship between Elvis and Priscilla, told from her perspective.The soundtrack is nice, you don\\'t hear much of Presley\\'s music. Unlike last year\\'s Elvis biopic, this one doesn\\'t cover an entire career; it\\'s solely focused on their marriage. It feels like we spend a significant amount of time watching how they met, but the later years felt like we were skipping stuff. Priscilla seems isolated and controlled by Elvis, whose presence is distant in the movie. The first part of the movie feels like we\\'re sitting through Priscilla\\'s memories, but the last half feels like we\\'re skimming through them.It\\'s hard not to compare them, but Austin Butler\\'s portrayal of Elvis is better than Jacob Elordi\\'s; Butler\\'s performance is almost iconic. Jacob\\'s fine, I just think there was a disconnect between Jacob\\'s speaking voice and his singing voice. The age difference between Elvis and Priscilla is depicted better here, more creepily, mainly due to the innocence Cailee Spaeny conveys, emphasized further by the height difference.There isn\\'t much chemistry between Elvis and Priscilla depicted in this film. Maybe it\\'s how it was in reality and how it\\'s depicted, but it seems like they fell in love over small talk, like \"hey, I miss home,\" \"hey, I like talking to you,\" and then it jumps to the abusive, controlling part of their relationship filled with arguments. Intimacy over small talk.I do think Cailee Spaeny did a great job as Priscilla. You can always tell how she feels, and the movie doesn\\'t need to explicitly state \"oh, she\\'s sad\" for you to understand. We witness the transformation of Priscilla over the years, and Spaeny flawlessly captures the journey from an innocent young fan to a frustrated woman trapped in a controlling and isolating relationship, culminating in her portrayal of a grown woman who had had enough of Elvis\\' behavior.Honestly, the film isn\\'t particularly special, especially considering the visually epic story we got from the 2021 Elvis movie. I thought it would bring something different or offer deeper insights, especially since it\\'s a well-known story and was recently told on the big screen. But it doesn\\'t feel deeply felt or ravishingly detailed as described.Vegas backdrop looked so fake, like not even cgi, more like when they build small miniature towns and shoot those. Movie\\'s Anticlimactic too.Certain aspects of her life are teased, like her affair with the instructor, which seems essential to the story but is only hinted at. It goes back to how the last years of their marriage are depicted, making it feel like we\\'re skimming through memories instead of experiencing them. Maybe it was just to keep her innocence.It\\'s a story that\\'s already famous, so I expected this film to bring a unique and possibly deeper perspective, but it doesn\\'t offer anything that isn\\'t already known. It feels like it missed the mark and turned out mediocre, uninteresting, and somewhat forgettable for me.',\n",
       " 'I\\'m an engineer. I designed computers, I grew up in the south during the 1950s and 1960s. I was heavily involved in the space race at an early age and watched every launch and recovery on black-and-white TV. I never saw separate restrooms and drinking fountains for \"colored\" but they were there. I never rode on segregated public buses, but they were there and I knew it. This movie, \"Hidden Figures,\" brings all of these worlds back to me. No, it\\'s not a painstakingly accurate picture. NASA didn\\'t have flat-panel screens back then. Communications between the ground and the Mercury capsules were not static-free. But a lot of this movie feels real. Very real.The protagonists in this movie are three women of color working in one of the most unwelcoming environments they might hope to find: NASA Langley, Virginia, in 1961. As women, they were employed as human \"computers\" because they were less expensive and they got their numbers right. As \"colored\" folk, they got their own separate (and sparse) restrooms and their own, separate dining facilities. This was not America\\'s shining hour, even in some place as lofty as NASA.At the same time, civil unrest was rising in the towns. This is the time of Martin Luther King\\'s rise to prominence. It\\'s a time just before the rise of militant civil rights groups. It\\'s a time when resistance to segregation and discrimination was still civil, but as the movie shows, that resistance was beginning to firm up and become widespread.There are several reasons to see this movie: from a civil rights perspective; from a feminism perspective; from the perspective of the early space race when we lagged the Soviet Union, badly. If you lived during this time, see the movie to remember. If you were born later, see this movie to see what things were like.',\n",
       " 'After seeing this film I was more than a little disgusted to see so many negative reviews. The main problem with this film I find is in the first 20-30 minutes, a common problem I spy in Luhrman films that should by no means define an entire film. Giving away nothing the film begins at a brisk and overly flamboyant pace but after a bit it hits what I like to call \"Baz\\'s golden point\", slows to absolute perfection. That first half hour will leave more than a few shaking their heads, but power through it and you will find The Great Gatsby in all its glory. Luhrman stays as true to the source as he can and Dicaprio gives yet another glorious performance. If I\\'m going to be honest I think a lot of the negative reviews coming in are due to the \"classic\" status of the book, people want to act like the hours of school discussions should make this film less fanciful and serious 100 percent of the time. Thing is we have that version twice over in the 1974 & 2000 adaption. Gatsby 2013 is beautiful, over the top, heart wrenching, and thoroughly enjoyable flick that I shall always highly recommend.',\n",

Perhaps they are encountering Flannery for the first time and the shock was too much. I saw this film last night and thought it was wonderful. The script artfully mixes together scenes from what is known of Flannery's life, entries from her prayer journal, and brief reenactments of five of her stories (The Life You Save May Be Your Own, Revelation, Parker's Back, Everything That Rises Must Converge, and Good Country People). Bravo to Maya Hawke, she is a tour de force, appearing as Flannery and in all five of the stories. Strong support from Laura Linney and the rest of the cast.

       " 'It\\'s not an original comment at all, but after enduring DRIVE-AWAY DOLLS, I really felt like I had been left dumber than I was going in. This movie is such a massive mis-fire, I\\'m really shocked it got any kind of release. What drew me in was my 40 year long affection for the films of the Coen Brothers. I figured with a film from Ethan Coen, I was in for a breezy good time like some of the Coen\\'s lesser works offered (I\\'m thinking INTOLERABLE CRUELTY or maybe BURN AFTER READING). What I got was a ridiculous mash-up of themes, none of which were well thought out or entertaining.This 84 minute movie follows Jamie (Margaret Qualley) and Marian (Geraldine Viswanathan), two friends who also happen to be lesbians (but are not \"together\"). Jamie is a wild-child from Texas, all one-night stands and hedonistic. Marian is buttoned-up and hasn\\'t had a lover in 3 years or more. While not exactly closeted, the 1999 setting of this film means she isn\\'t exactly openly gay either. They decide to take a trip down to Tallahassee (I don\\'t even recall all the rationale for that), and to make it financially viable to do so, they use a drive-away service that hooks them up with a car bound for that very Florida city. Sadly, the owner of the drive-away service thought the two young ladies worked for the criminals who ARE supposed to be driving the car south, leading to a pair of \"goons\" (as listed in the credits) to chase after the two young ladies in a time before real cell phone coverage or other tech that might have made the pursuit easier.Antics ensue, revolving mostly around the sexual shenanigans of the two girls (mostly kinda icky), the endless arguments between the two goons (none of which were interesting at all) and the eventual discovery of what was in the trunk of the car that the ladies aren\\'t supposed to know about (involving the creation of plaster casts made of the private parts of certain conservative political figures).My biggest problem with the film was the ridiculous, over-the-top portrayal of lesbian sexuality. Coupled with the silly plaster casts we are often obliged to gaze at, and you\\'ve got a film that feels like it was written by a ninth grade boy who doesn\\'t understand how sex works and REALLY doesn\\'t understand how lesbian sex works. Most of the sex scenes were embarrassing to watch, they were so childish.These scenes MIGHT have been at least some fun, had they not starred the truly dreadful Margaret Qualley. I\\'ve seen her give decent performances before (NOVITIATE, ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD), but here her wild energy is uncontained and generic. Nothing she does feels rooted in any kind of reality, even the skewed reality of this film. It wants to be a daring performance; instead, it is silly and not for one moment did it feel like I watching a real person. Viswanathan, on the other hand, is marginally convincing, and the only character we root for at all.Pedro Pascal and Matt Damon make very brief cameo appearances. They both look dreadfully embarrassed to be in the film. (I felt actively bad for Damon.) And the film even manages to make the delightful Colman Domingo uninteresting.A deep disappointment, insulting to lesbians (rather than \"liberating\" as I assume it intended to be) and simply stunning to be coming from Ethan Coen. Avoid!!',\n",
       " \"The second the movie was over, I was dumbstruck, and I wasn't the only one. When the movie ended I thought there would be a big round of applause but when I turned around I saw that about half the audience was still in their seats. I looked at a couple of people, some were speachless and most were crying. Nonetheless I didn't hear a word. When I thought about it, i realized an applause would have been ridiculous.When someone asked me how the movie was I was going to say it was amazing, but that wouldn't have done the movie justice. The movie was an extremely moving, emotional experience.The cast was absolutely flawless, Jim Caviezel gave a powerful performance as Jesus, Maia Morgenstern as Mary brought me to tears, and even though Monica Bellucci spoke only a few lines, her performance and beauty astonished me. The score was incredible. It had a middle-eastern feel to it, and was timeless and beautiful.Most aspects of the movie were perfect to me. Instead of a squeaky clean version of the life of Jesus it was a realistic and heartbreaking portrayal of his final hours. The Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew languages, and wonderful cinematography made you really feel like you were in first century Jerusalem. The flashbacks truly had an emotional impact on me.While watching this movie I forgot about everything else in the world. Mel Gibson did an incredible job as a director and he truly was brave for taking on this project despite all the controversy.As for the two main concerns of most people, the ultra-violence, and the alleged anti-semetism these are my views on the two.Everything people are saying about the violence is true. It is brutal, gory, and quite possibly the most violent work in cinematic history. This R-Rating is very well justified and an NC-17 would have made sense. If you are the type of person that cannot bear violence, this is definately not the movie for you. Some scenes of torture last about 10 minutes when you feel you've seen enough after 30 seconds. But, the violence I feel was absolutely necessary. The movie is about the suffering/passion of Jesus, and turning the camera away would not have an impact on you. The movie shows what Jesus actually went through for all of mankind's sins (according to Christianity). Mel Gibson did not exagerate the violence or make it look like horror movie or Kill Bill violence. As Jay Leno said on his show the other night, when Jesus was hit it felt like WE were being hit as opposed to other violent movies were you feel like YOU are the one hitting the person. I don't think anyone can say that every single hit upon Jesus didn't affect him/her somehow.As for the anti-semetism in the movie, I didn't find it was as bad as everyone is making it out to be. The thing that made me see why people were criticizing Mel Gibson for was that instead of spreading the blame somewhat on the Jewish high priests (Sanhedrin) and mostly on Pilate, 99% of the blame was put on the Sanhedrin, which seemed false to me considering that historically it is known that Pilate was a vicious monster, and in the movie he seems like a gentle person and reluctant to crucify Jesus. I simply didn't buy the fact that Pilate would be so nice. The movie can be considered anti-first-century-Romans, and anti-Sanhedrin, but I did not feel the movie was attacking the Jewish religion, or the entire Jewish people. But the movie is not anti-semitic for these reasons: 1. It is made evident that it was Jesus' prophecy and destiny is to die. He could probably have escaped from Gethsemane or even the cross (if he truly had ''powers''). He was born to die, and there is no blame to be placed on anyone. If anything, the Romans of that time are portrayed horribly (though realistically), and they are the ones that made him suffer tremendously before his death. 2. Basically all the ''Good Guys'' in the movie are Jewish. Jesus himself was a Jew, Mary was, The man that helped Jesus carry the cross was Jewish, Veronica the woman that brought Jesus water and wiped his face was, and many Jews were screaming in the crowd against the torture and crucifixion of Jesus. (Personally, I don't know why Pilate was portrayed so nicely. It's not like the Jews had the ultimate power. It was ultimately HIS decision to have Jesus crucified.)An aspect of the film that intrigued me was the character of Satan, and the demons in the movie. When I first found out Satan was in the movie, I was scared it would be a red man with horns and a pitchfork, but he/she is portrayed subtly. Everything about him/her was very Eerie.Mel Gibson deserves a lot of respect for making this film. He made the movie the way HE thought it was and though most historians or even religious figures would not agree completely to what happened, it is a general idea as to what those final hours were. When reading the new testament or hearing the story of Jesus, it's hard to understand what it was actually like for Jesus to go through all that pain, and what it was like for Mary to watch her son get tortured and crucified. The movie really put things in perspective for me.Some people are criticizing him for adding things never written in the gospels such as demons harassing Judas Iscariot, most scenes with Satan, and the torture from Gethsemene to the Jewish court, but he had to fill the blanks in the Gospels with what he thought might have happened.\\nIn conclusion, not everyone will like this movie. Some will love it, and some will hate it. But, I think that if you can endure the extreme violence and torture you should at least see it before you judge it. My opinion: 10/10\",\n",

       " 'Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers arthouse-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you\\'re not able to take a few sci-fi leaps of faith, ignore this review, as well. We\\'ll both be better off.This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it\\'s not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $100 million budget (in 1991!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores of stuntmen used.This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CG. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. Without the tools, this film would be nothing.But, a little bit of background is due. This is the sequel to the Terminator (1984), whose premise was that a near-indestructible cyborg is sent by evil self-aware machines from the near future to destroy the mother-to-be of the military commander who would lead the humans to a victory over the machines. Oh, and this terminator machine would come from a time of war between men and machines which followed a nuclear exchange that left billions of people dead, first. In Terminator 2, John Connor (the commander-to-be) is about 12 years old, and his mother (Sarah) is feverishly trying to prepare him for his fate, even as she tries to stop the factors that will lead to the nuclear war and the entire terrible future that made all this necessary. The machines now send a superior, more intelligent, shape-shifting cyborg (T1000) into the past, to kill John himself. Meanwhile, future-John reprograms the ex-evil Terminator (T101) from the original film, and sends him into the past to PROTECT John against the T1000.That\\'s your basic plot. It does involve travel into the past, so it immediately presents a time-travel paradox which can\\'t really be resolved. In order to even try watching this movie, you MUST LOOK PAST THE PARADOX. If you don\\'t, this movie has zero credibility, and is not worth your time.What happens after the two terminators appear in the past is a wild ride rife with macho action, dark reflection on the nature of man, and a few rays of hope, here and there. Schwarzenegger (the good terminator) and Patrick (the bad one) make for such effective foes that the times they meet on-screen are completely breathtaking (and odd, given that you repeatedly see the relatively slim T1000 through Arnie through a wall or two). Hamilton, as Sarah Connor, is a wonderful character -- tough beyond all belief and completely focussed on preventing the nuclear war and ensuring John\\'s safety, yet clearly a little out of her mind with paranoia and anger; amazingly, you see actual character development (specifically, when John and T101 arrive at Dyson\\'s house to prevent her from doing what she wants to) in her otherwise 2-dimensional character. And Furlong, as John, is not bad himself as the extroverted kid who\\'s confused by the fact that everyone except his mom tell him his entire upbringing was based on a lie. The bit players all do their jobs well, particularly Earl Boen who plays the semi-sadistic mental hospital warden that stands between Sarah Connor and her son (until the T1000 makes a chilling entrance).With these players set in motion, it\\'s up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they\\'re evenly spaced through the movie. I mean, who doesn\\'t cheer (at least inside) when Arnold steps out of the biker bar, fully clad in leather when \"Bad to the Bone\" music starts to blast? The guy absolutely bleeds coolness. And the T1000 absolutely bleeds evil. But, with so many great moments, you\\'d think the pacing would be a little uneven... not really! The film shifts from place to place with an ease that makes perfect sense, never giving you the time to start being a little nitpicking jerk, always driving forward, but always doing so thoughtfully and with attention to detail.Of course, this wouldn\\'t be an action movie without some action. There\\'s plenty of it, and it\\'s perfectly done. The CG effects for the shape-shifting T1000 were cutting-edge for the time, and still look great (whoever said differently below is simply incorrect) -- even if they\\'re completely commonplace today. The stunts are completely insane in scale (at one point, a helicopter flies under a highway overpass; at another, a motorcycle jumps from the 2nd floor of a building into a flying chopper). (Probably, only the Matrix and the Lord of the Rings movies compare in terms of the level of stunt insanity.) And the gunplay is delivered in perfect Cameron-Schwarzenegger style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you\\'ll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you\\'ll see them used well. The film is violent, and somewhat bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil characters, not the ones you root for (Quentin Tarantino fans: sorry). And then the truly amazing scenes that bypass acting are shocking and memorable -- just wait until the nuclear detonation sequence.I\\'m not sure what else you would want in a movie. Probably moral content, and the movie has a very clear pro-human, anti-war message. The message is a bit stale, and the delivery IS, at times, a little heavy-handed (and some moments with the T101 seem just a bit unrealistic, towards the end), but the movie has heart, and that you cannot deny. Plus, it simply rocks. 10/10',\n",
       " 'Fahad Fazil is the most overrated actor in the history of mankind and cinema. He has been promoted by mediocre frauds like Bharadwaj Rangan and Shyam Pushkaran. He looks like a small kid or some normie in most of the scenes in this movie. When he tries to act tough, it is a joke. Fahad is the greatest recent fraud perpetrated upon Indian society. Sajin Gopu towers over Fahad in most of the scenes in this film. Sajin is the real soul of the film.As for the film, it is silly and goofy. Clearly made for the Instagram and Youtube reel generation. The three lead actors are even worse actors than Fahadh. Yes, they are in the league of Basil Joseph - skinny fat bodies with crappy dialog delivery and zero screen presence. Apparently they were selected after an audition. These three actors are so bad it is nearly impossible to feel any kind of sympathy for them or their shenanigans.This is a horrendous film by a third rate filmmaker like Jeethu Madhavan. Atleast Jeethu does not treat us to shots of dirty toilets (he does but not for too long). Though I am glad that he is not woke or anything. Hope Sajin Gopu becomes a huge star.',\n",

       " \"'Jaws' is the original summer blockbuster, setting the standard by which all others are measured. It's the Michael Jordan of cinema: there will never be another 'Jaws,' simply because the film so profoundly changed the way movies are made and marketed.Based on Peter Benchley's bestselling novel, 'Jaws' centers around the fictional North Atlantic resort island of Amity, which finds itself terrorized by an enormous great white shark. Our hero is Martin Brody, a New York cop who took the job as Chief of the Amity PD to get his family out of the city and then finds himself in the midst of an unprecedented crisis none of his prior experience has prepared him for. The remains of young Christine Watkins are found on the beach, the apparent victim of a shark attack(Chrissie Watkins' death scene at the opening of the movie is one of the most legendary in the history of film). Chief Brody wants to close the beaches, but is refused permission by Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) and the Amity selectmen, all of whom fear that news of a shark attack off of Amity will threaten the summer tourist trade, on which the town depends for its very survival. The Mayor and his lackies persuade Chief Brody that such incidents are always isolated, and, inexperienced in such matters, he grudgingly agrees to keep quiet.Consequently, the shark kills again (and again), and Chief Brody eventually finds himself dealing both with his own moral guilt for agreeing to hush up the first shark attack and with an enormous human and social catastrophe which appears to be his sole responsibility. Help comes first in the form of Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, in the role that propelled him to stardom), an icthyologist and oceanographer dispatched to Amity to lend his expertise. Together, Hooper and Brody struggle in vain against both the shark and Mayor Vaughan, who is certain that keeping the beaches open for the sake of the town's economy (and his own real-estate business) is worth the gamble.Finally, Brody and Hooper charter an expedition with the enigmatic, vaguely malevolent Quint (Robert Shaw), Amity's most feared and respected shark hunter, to find and kill the shark and save the town from financial disaster. What ensues is an epic, archetypal man vs. beast quest that would make Herman Melville and Joseph Campbell proud. Our shark, it turns out, is way above average size, terrifically swift and powerful, and uncannily smart, to boot. Hooper, the scientist, is awestruck at having encountered the Bigfoot of the sea; Quint, the crafty fisherman with a serious chip on his shoulder against sharks, realizes he has met the ultimate test of his skills; Brody, who swims poorly and is afraid of water, must overcome abject fear and disorientation just to maintain his composure. Robert Shaw's Quint is one of the greatest anti-heroes the movies have ever seen. He is funny and frightening all at once, and the famous soliloquy in which he recalls the tragic sinking of the USS Indianapolis--where, over the course of a week waiting for rescue, at least 90 US Navy personnel died from shark attack wounds--is one of the most chilling and unforgettable performances ever committed to film. 'Jaws' is the movie that made Steven Spielberg's career, and it's among his finest. It's easy to forget because of his enormously successful blockbusters that Spielberg is a phenomenally skillful and artful director. His timing is superb, he mixes horror with comedy to brilliant effect, he gets great performances out of his actors, and his love for special effects has never overwhelmed his understanding of the importance of story and character. That said, the most brilliant aspect of 'Jaws' was a serendipitous accident.The special effects team had yet to fully troubleshoot 'Bruce,' the mechanical shark, by the time filming was to begin. Under tight budget restraints and enormous studio pressure, Spielberg had no choice but to press on while his crew labored vainly to make the shark work in the cold and corrosive north Atlantic seawater. To compensate for the absence of the non-functional fake shark, Spielberg used shots from the shark's point of view and John Williams' famous two-note theme to create the illusion of the shark's presence in the early scenes. Fortunately the crew was ultimately able to get Bruce into operational status in time to film the big showdown, and some of the scenes are filled in with live-shark footage filmed by Australian underwater video pioneers Ron and Valerie Taylor. Consequently, the audience's fear is magnified by the fact that, for the majority of the film, they cannot see the shark, creating suspense towards the climax of the confrontation between man and beast on Quint's fishing boat.'Jaws' succeeds on almost every level. It is terrifying without being grotesque, and spectacular without being unbelievable (if the shark looks a little fake, remember that, at the time 'Jaws' was released, 'Space Invaders' was on the cutting edge of computer graphics design and there was no such thing as 'Shark Week on the Discovery Channel'). Roy Scheider's Brody is a quintessential everyman, an average guy beset by fear and guilt who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances and rises to the occasion. Dreyfuss' Hooper is brash and brave enough not to come off as nerdy or self-righteous, and his friendship with Brody becomes the backbone of the movie (Spielberg and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb wisely deviated from the novel in regards to the character of Hooper, who was originally Brody's nemesis). Robert Shaw's Quint is a modern-day Captain Ahab, a worthy foe for the malevolent shark. The suspense is potent and the action thrilling, but the humor, emotion, and character development make this movie much more than a summer blockbuster.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m sure this film is going to divide audiences, in the same way that \"Kingsman\" did.It\\'s 1977 Los Angeles. Star Wars has premiered. Disco is in full swing. And porn star Misty Mountains has just died (spectacularly). It\\'s pretty disturbing then that dodgy licensed private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) has been hired two days later to find Misty by the slightly kooky Mrs Glenn (Lois Smith, the equally kooky doctor in \"Minority Report\") who saw her through the windows of Misty\\'s home. Never one to turn down a pay check, Holland takes the case and the trail leads him to search for a missing girl called Amelia (Margaret Qualley). This leads him right into the substantial fists of the \\'heavy for hire\\' Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe), who\\'s been hired by Amelia NOT to be found. But it\\'s clear that Amelia is at the centre of a tornado of intrigue, since her mother Judith (Kim Basinger) is head of the Justice department and there are some heavies from New York and Detroit looking for Amelia too.As the film\\'s tag-line admits \"The Nice Guys\" are \"far from nice\", and this is a sort of bromance buddy movie of the likes of \"Lethal Weapon\". (And that comparison is 100% valid since - and I honestly discovered this after I wrote that - director Shane Black (\"Iron Man 3\") got into cinema by writing the screenplay for the original \"Lethal Weapon\" back in 1987). But \"The Nice Guys\" has an edge that those films of the 80\\'s couldn\\'t have got away with. Subtle it ain\\'t. There is a lot of violence, a bit of 70\\'s porn and some fruity language that sensitive viewers may find offensive. (All in all, it\\'s a bit of a surprise that it got away with a \\'15\\' certificate in the UK).But it\\'s also insanely funny at times. Some of the sight gags are laugh out loud material (and I don\\'t tend to act on that often in a packed cinema). You might recall in \"Diamond\\'s Are Forever\" that a Vegas hood tosses Plenty O\\' Toole out of Bond\\'s hotel window. \"Good Shot\" quips Bond. \"I didn\\'t know there was a pool down there\" responds the hoodlum. The basics of this scene are given a fresh and wonderfully gory rework that is truly memorable.Gosling and Crowe have great chemistry together (although the degree of acting required by Crowe is debatable: he looks and acts like he seems to in most media interviews!) Some of their dialogue appears distinctly ad-libbed, which shows how comfortable they were with the roles. And Matt Bomer and Beau Knapp make memorably crazed villains. A role that unfortunately does irritate is Qualley\\'s: the character of Amelia is supposed to be a bit crazed, but her speaking part is 120% off the scale.The acting star of the show though is young Australian Angourie Rice as Holland\\'s morally-centred and bright daughter Holly, who steals just about every scene she\\'s in. A young lady to watch for the future.1970\\'s LA is nicely realised, with nice little subliminal drop-in shots: a Jaws 2 poster; Tower Records; the original Hollywood Tower Hotel. And the film naturally attracts some banging\\' 70\\'s tunes to the soundtrack, with Al Green peerless over the closing titles.But it\\'s not perfect. The plot is quite impenetrable (I\\'m still unclear exactly what the relationship between Misty and Amelia was). And Black\\'s screenplay (written with Anthony Bagarozzi) over-eggs the pudding of the final showdown scene. But while it won\\'t be to everyone\\'s tastes, I thought it was a blast from beginning to end: a guilty pleasure of bad taste that begs for a sequel. I would go to see the Gosling/Crowe show again. One of the most entertaining films of the year so far.Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com to see the graphical version of this review and provide feedback on your views. (Thanks).',\n",

       " \"I expected so much more from the movie, as the director's prior movie, The Witch, was an excellent film. Additionally, the trailer for this movie immediately intrigued. However, upon seeing it, I left the theater initially confused but then after realizing it wasn't worth much energy, I just accepted the reality of my reaction: disappointment. It was underwhelming. The first hour or so was intriguing and certainly set things up in an intriguing manner but what was set up was ultimately neglected in a pursuit for style and atmosphere over substance. The movie is most definitely a play at metaphors, symbolism, hidden meaning, references to seafaring myths, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Greek myths (a seeming melding together of Sisyphus and Prometheus), and so on but the muddled execution made me suspect that there wasn't nearly as much going on as the cinephiles and movie theorists will invent for it.Essentially, after the first hour this became narratively unclear and focused instead on repetitive fever dream scenarios and bombastic speeches and emotional conflict between the two characters - all of which were well done and well executed but only raised question marks without a clear story or message. Perhaps it is possible to decrypt it but nothing about the themes or the atmosphere or the story was compelling enough to merit the effort of seeking deeper meaning in this movie. The movie was cinematographically fantastic, well acted, well made, and so on. But the script and story failed after the first hour.\",\n",
       " \"I'm so confused about how this has a decent rating. This movie was painfully boring and predictable. The acting was absolutely atrocious. The story was as bland as it comes.

But I will never watch this one again. It's just so bad. I can't even laugh at it. Honestly, I'm insulted that anyone would put something out that is so bad. And that people would review it so well. I only went to see this movie based off of the reviews. It seems like people have lost touch with what makes a good movie.\",\n",
       " \"Already drawn to the premise of this film, I had high expectations of it, and was particularly interested in seeing Blake Lively in the lead role as a 107 year old eternally young woman. From only seeing her work in Gossip Girl, which was adequate but not particularly memorable, I was keen to see what her acting range was like. Not only did Lively impress me, but the film did also, surpassing my expectations. The Age of Adaline is not only visually beautiful, (props to cinematographer David Lanzenberg) but the story is also. Yes, this is a romance film, but the evocative story raises questions from the viewer about life, death, and love. Michiel Huisman is great in his role as a sensitive romantic who yearns to be close to and understand Adaline - well done to the writers for creating a male romantic lead who isn't unrealistically perfect and cliché. Harrison Ford impressed me greatly, especially in his scenes with Lively, so much so that I was brought to tears through a mere look. Ellen Burstyn as Flemming provided a charming voice of reason for the protagonist. The score was also wonderfully done, making the emotional scenes all the more powerful, and the costume designer did very well in allowing the audience to fill in the time blanks without knowing the era through the narrated dates. Overall, a beautifully crafted film with a wonderful story and powerful performances that will completely captivate the viewers.\",\n",
       " 'Beverly Hills Cop was a big hit in the 1980\\'s. The film was loved by many action fans, as well as comedy fans and movie buffs at the time. It is still being admired by many people as one of the funniest cop movies ever made.The thing I love about this movie is that Eddie Murphy was perfectly cast as the Axel Foley character. Originally, Sylvester Stallone was considered for the role. Thank God he wasn\\'t! Eddie Murphy was perfect for the role, because he can be a clever cop, and can at the same time be very funny! Another great thing about Beverly Hills Cop is its smashing soundtrack. There are some great hit songs from the 1980\\'s featured in the soundtrack, as well as an excellent musical score which can be heard throughout the movie (to me, the musical score is the Beverly Hills Cop \"theme song\").Perhaps the only downside of Beverly Hills Cop is that it can be pretty slow in certain scenes. Hardcore action fans would probably be disappointed by this. But let\\'s face it: Beverly Hills Cop is not an all-out mindless action movie. It is actually a clever comedy with elements of action present within.To conclude, Beverly Hills Cop is arguably Eddie Murphy\\'s best film since he fits the Axel Foley character perfectly. There are many funny scenes featuring Eddie Murphy that will have people laughing (even the action scenes can be cleverly funny)! P.S: Look out for cameos by Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot, and Damon Wayans!',\n",
       " 'As a massive admirer of Luca Guadagnino\\'s work, it saddens me to say that Bones & All is disappointing.Even though the cinematography and atmosphere are beautiful and what you would expect from the visual master, the film suffers from tonal shifts and a very talky script that is only saved by a fantastic turn by Mark Rylance. His menacing presence is the feature only redeeming quality.The narrative is overstretched by a terribly slow pace reinforced by wooden dialogues between lovers that don\\'t have much chemistry to begin with. Timothée Chalamet is clearly miscast as his sweet and soft demeanor don\\'t match with the supposed danger and inner violence of his character.Star of the show, Taylor Russell is beautiful and haunting. She also carries much of the movie on her frail shoulder. But the underdeveloped family moments and repetitive travel adventures don\\'t help to build much of her personality. So when we get to the core horror aspect of the movie it mostly fails. Most \"gory\" moments are contrived, shoehorned inside the romance. They are too few, tonally all over the place and end up underwhelming.After the masterful Suspiria, I was really expecting Guadagnino to deliver on the horror front but I think he got sucked away by the gorgeous landscapes and forgot to build up tension or fear. Bones & All ultimately ends up being a tiresome teen romance road trip interrupted by bizarre gory scenes. I will just rewatch Kathryn Bigelow\\'s masterpiece \"Near Dark\" which I think would have been the perfect inspiration.',\n",

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is darker & more violent than any previous MCU movie, which could be considered a strength.

This movie is an entertaining ride, but it's a little too messy to stand on its own.\",\n",
       " \"Sometimes ads can be misleading. It's like when you see an attractive person from far away and the closer they get the less attractive they become. The ads are selling a raunchy sex comedy where the hot lead actress is going to take her top off. That isn't the case, however. Yes, there is a make-out scene between the two stars where the male lead...has an accident. And there's also a shaving scene that will rival the one from the third American Pie. Aside from those two scenes and a few others, the movie is actually a really sweet romantic comedy.It's about Molly (Alice Eve), a sexy event planner who gets harassed at the airport by a sleazy employee. Luckily, Kirk (Jay Baruchel), another employee, comes to her rescue. Kirk is dopey-looking, skinny, and a bit of a push-over. He's a 5, according to his friends. Yet, Molly, whose a hard 10, finds him amusing and a perfect gentlemen. Soon, to the surprise of many, they start dating. They like each other and get along fine, but their friends keep questioning the relationship and giving them self-doubt. Kirk is constantly reminded that he's a 5 and she's a 10. It goes against all logic. Molly is constantly reminded that she only went out with him in the first place because he is safe. Her previous boyfriend, also a 10, broke her heart and now she's with someone whose in no position to do that. So, does she really like (or love) him? If there's one flaw to this film it's that the filmmakers (or studio) went for the R-rating just for the sake of appearing edgy during the marketing. Anyone expecting The 40-Year-Old Virgin is going to be disappointed. Although the raunchy scenes are funny. They just stick out and disrupt the tone. In a way, this movie is like The Girl Next Door. Elisha Cuthbert played a porn star that needs to be rescued by her nerdy next door neighbor (Emile Hirsch). Yet, she's not naked and doesn't do any wild sex scenes. It's a waste of a concept. A regular PG-13 comedy about two teenagers from opposite worlds that fall in love would have been just fine. It wouldn't have sold any tickets, but it would have been honest. So, remember, if you decide to see this film it's pretty tame and a lot more girly than the ads are willing to admit. It's a really good date movie, but not one you want to see only with your friends.\",\n",
       " 'When this film first came out in 1980, I remember going to see it on opening night. The sheer terror that I experienced in viewing \"The Shining\" was enough to make me go to bed with the lights turned ON every night for an entire summer. This movie just scared the life out of me, which is what still happens every time I rent the video for a re-watch. I have seen The Shining at least six or seven times, and I still believe it to be simultaneously and paradoxically one of the most frightening and yet funniest films I\\'ve ever seen. Frightening because of the extraordinarily effective use of long shots to create feelings of isolation, convex lens shots to enhance surrealism, and meticulously scored music to bring tension levels to virtually unbearable levels. And \"funny\" because of Jack Nicholson\\'s outrageous and in many cases ad-libbed onscreen antics. It never ceases to amaze me how The Shining is actually two films in one, both a comedy AND a horror flick. Ghostly apparitions of a strikingly menacing nature haunt much of the first half of the film, which gradually evolve into ever more serious physical threats as time progresses. Be that as it may, there is surprisingly little violence given the apparent intensity, but that is little comfort for the feint of heart as much of the terror is more implied than manifest. The Shining is a truly frightening movie that works symbolically on many levels, but is basically about human shortcomings and the way they can be exploited by unconscious forces combined with weakness of will. This film scares the most just by using suggestion to turn your own imagination against you. The Shining is a brilliant cinematic masterpiece, the likes of which have never been seen before or since.

I had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic Jewish Holocaust film where good triumphs over evil and in between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by the Germans to add some flavour.How wrong I was.This is one of the best films I have ever seen and what it did to me I cannot describe in words. But in a nutshell, it moved me, made me cry, made me feel like I was in the Polish ghetto in 1940, and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as I walked out of the theater and thanked God that I live in the free society that I do. Roman Polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like Chinatown and Rosemary\\'s Baby but this is his crowning achievement. I think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years Oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film. I believe that the Oscar\\'s are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else, so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year, it tells you that it should have won best picture but the Weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone, hence a charlatan like Chicago takes top prize. Sorry for the digression here but when you compare a \"film\" like Chicago to a masterpiece like The Pianist, there really is one clear cut winner. They handed out the statue to the wrong movie.The Pianist follows up and coming piano player Wlad Spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos, surviving only by the kindness of strangers. I think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because Spielzman is a man that we can all relate to. He is not a hero, he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. He is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can. Only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide. And this is how I related to him. If put in his position, how would I react? Exactly the way he did. This is a man that had everything taken from him. His livelihood, his family, his freedom and almost his life. There is no time for heroics here. Adrien Brody embodies the spirit of Spielzman and his win at this years Oscars was one of the happiest moments I have had watching the festivities. His speech was even better but that is a topic for another time.Ultimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the German soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes I\\'ve witnessed. With very little dialogue, it is in the eyes, the face, the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know. I think it is this scene that won Brody his Oscar. This is one of the all time great performances.I think Polanski spoke from the heart here. He has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other. I think The Pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done, Chicago will be forgotten the way Ordinary People was forgotten and when people talk about the film The Pianist, they will do so with reverence and respect. This is a cinematic masterpiece.10 out of 10',\n",

       " 'The first time I saw this was when I was with a date, and she thought it was an awesome movie. I didn\\'t.The second time I saw this was last night on TV. It still sucks.As a love story this sucks. As having Julia portray a street hooker, this is repulsive. To me she was a librarian with a miniskirt and heels. She had no tough shell to her. She wasn\\'t tortured, anguished, enraged, starving or anything else. Her \"HOOKER\" character was so flawed, like comparing a cubic zircon to a diamond. The two simply don\\'t fit, no matter what they look like.The ONLY cast I felt was worth watching was the 2 bitchy saleswomen, whom were excellently cast. They did such a fine job that I hated them for the few seconds that they were on screen. They had real definition, for the minor roles. OK, so the movie wasn\\'t entirely trash...the two ignorant saleswomen saved the film.Aside from those two women sales people, the rest of the cast...including the big names was just crap. Either everybody was an ass-kisser or had absolutely no reason to fill any dialog in the movie aside from just complimenting Julia Roberts or kissing ass to Richard Gere.This was a movie about how when you walk around in high-heels and a tight skirt in Beverly Hills, people leer at you and guys who work in hotels gawk as if they just had a baseball bat struck to their face.While in reality, the women who are dressed to the nines in Beverly Hills are hookers and prostitutes to a higher degree, but since they aren\\'t wearing the gaudy Madonna looking jewelry or the patent boots, they can look down on the others who do.The hotel cast was sickeningly sad to watch, and anybody who had any real character had less than a minute of screen time.This is an insult to romantic movies, comedies, dramas and even to prostitutes who face wealthy customers on a daily basis with hopes of having their lives work out perfect.The story is about Julia Roberts being PIMPED (yes PIMPED) by a multimillionaire in a business suit and limousine.She is still owned, still told how to act, how to move, what to wear, what to say, where to go and what to do. He is more controlling than a street pimp, but the folks at Disney/buena vista butter it up to make it easier to swallow.Had Richard Gere been a black man with a gold tooth and an AK-47 at his side instead of an attaché case, this movie would be about how a woman has to struggle to get away from the harshness of prostitution. Same story, different characters will make a very different outlook.Oh yeah, change the white man for a black man or Asian or Spanish, have the land business deal be changed to a deal of weapons or narcotics and the entire concept of romantic comedy is thrown away.As far as I\\'m concerned, Pretty Woman is still trash, dressed with ribbons and bows.I didn\\'t like it 15 years ago, when I didn\\'t understand it and was led by the Hollywood hype. I hate it now that i can see past the pretty decorations that is called \"love\".This movie is NOT a romantic comedy. It\\'s a story on how to control a woman as long as you have the means and income to do so.This is an insult to strong women, weak women and women in general, as well as to my television screen.Do I hate it? Yes. Does it suck? Yes Would I recommend it to you? NO...well maybe if I really hated you.Will this review get posted? We\\'ll see.Anywayz, that\\'s all for now.',\n",
       " \"I can't stop smiling at the mastery of filmmaking on display in Smile. The directing is topnotch. All of the technical aspects are pristine, especially the sound design. The musical score greatly enhances the mood. Even something as simple as transition shots are stunning. It's visually elite.I can't stop smiling at how ridiculously scary this movie is. I'm a 37-year-old man who has seen hundreds of horror flicks of all types. And yet this movie had me on edge from beginning to end. At points I was paranoid that someone was standing off to the side in the shadows of the theater. It continued afterwards, when I was startled by what turned out to be the shadow of the car behind me. And then again when the curbside lady brought my food out. I can't remember the last time a movie did this to me.I can't stop smiling at stumbling upon what might be my favorite movie of the year. I went in, as usual, without watching any trailers or looking up reviews/ratings. I had no expectations and was fully blown away. I was either smiling or had my jaw dropped for most of the runtime.I can't stop smiling at how impactful some of these scenes and moments are. I will never forget them. They are seared into my brain forever. Whoever came up with them, whoever designed them has to be some combination of genius and possibly disturbed. I love it. Maybe I'm disturbed too.I jumped about 20 times. None of the jump scares are cheap. They are all creative and earned. The few that are predictable still startle. I sometimes laughed afterwards at how bad it got me.I had a blast with Smile. It's not for the faint of heart or horror novices. For everyone else, for horror fans, for people who want high-quality cinema, this is the movie for you. (2 viewings, opening Friday UltraScreen 9/30/2022, UltraScreen 10/6/2022)\",\n",
       " '\"Die Hard\" is the prototype type for the modern action film.  Since it\\'s also one of the best action films ever made, that happens to be a very good thing.  \"Die Hard\" is lean, mean, and doesn\\'t contain a single second of wasted screen time. The direction, the action, the story, the acting . . . every aspect of this film comes close to big-budget action movie perfection. Since \"Die Hard\" was first released in 1988, it\\'s difficult to think of a blockbuster action film that doesn\\'t follow the basic structure and format of \"Die Hard\" . . . or, for that matter, is better than \"Die Hard\".\\n\"Die Hard\" is about John McClane (Bruce Willis, in one of his all-time best film performances), a basically good, honest New York cop with a penchant for annoying authority figures.   Traveling to Los Angeles in a last ditch attempt to patch things up with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), John McClane suddenly finds himself involved in a hostage situation. Terrorists, led by the enigmatic Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), have taken over the office building in which Holly is working, and with Gruber holding the upper hand over the LAPD and FBI forces in Los Angeles, it\\'s up to John McClane to save the day . . . .Kudos should be given to both director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven DeSouza -- the film is tight, electrifying, and clever, which is something few action films can ever claim.  The story isn\\'t completely believable, but it\\'s believable enough, and it manages to move along at a quick enough pace to where the most glaring plotholes can easily be glossed over.  There\\'s also enough twists and wrinkles thrown into the story to keep the audience guessing as to what\\'s going to happen next . . . and the surprises don\\'t come out of left field, but are actually clever and well thought-out.  (The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus.) Simply put, \"Die Hard\" is one of the smartest and savviest action screenplays ever written.  McTiernan holds up his end of the film admirably as well -- he uses the claustrophobic nature of the office building to great effect (particularly in any scene involving an elevator shaft), and he keeps the film rolling at a rollercoaster pace, building up the anticipation of the audience before unleashing the action.  A lot of recent action films just fly along at a mindless, breakneck pace, without ever allowing the story to breathe or the suspense to build . . . unlike those films, \"Die Hard\" knows how to maximize the impact of each and every scene, and that\\'s why it stands out so clearly from them all.  With \"Die Hard\", John McTiernan puts on a perfect clinic as to how to pace an action movie.As for the acting, it\\'s darn near close to perfect.  Bruce Willis is awesome as John McClane.  As played by Willis, McClane\\'s a smartass with a distinct disdain for being given orders . . . but McClane\\'s also clever, and knows how to keep cool under pressure.  There\\'s more to McClane than the stereotypical tough guy hero.  Fortunately, the role was given to Bruce Willis, who infuses McClane with the perfect mix of cocky arrogance and stone-cold heroism.  The fact that Willis plays McClane as a man often in disbelief of his own situation, and who struggles in his fight against bad guys instead of just killing bad guys with ease, like most stereotypical action heroes -- well, not only does it make the character much more believable, it\\'s darn brilliant.  (The fact that Willis also knows how to deliver a deadpan one-liner better than anybody else in Hollywood makes the character all the better.)  There\\'s only a handful of movies where both character and actor are a completely perfect match; Bruce Willis as John McClane is one such perfect match.Also worthy of mention is Alan Rickman\\'s performance as the villain Hans Gruber.  The Machiavellian Gruber would\\'ve been an easy villain to turn into little more than a scenery-chewing Bond villain . . . fortunately, Rickman doesn\\'t travel the easy route.  Gruber, as played by Rickman, is cold and calculating, and actually acts smart, instead of merely claiming to be smart and then being thoroughly outwitted by the hero.  He always appears to have an ace hidden up his sleeve, and is so convincing at giving this impression, it\\'s hard to tell throughout the film whether he or McClane truly have the upper hand.  Other actors probably could\\'ve played Gruber fairly well, but Rickman makes Gruber one of the all-time great villains.  As for the rest of the cast, they\\'re all pretty good.  Bonnie Bedelia does a nice job as John\\'s soon-to-be-ex-wife Holly -- she plays her with enough smarts and feistiness to break the usual \"damsel in distress\" mold.  It\\'s also worth mentioning that Paul Gleason, who plays the obstinate police chief Robinson, pretty much sets up the modern action movie stereotype of the authority figure who refuses to heed the advice of the maverick hero.  The character is stupid to a fault, and he\\'s wonderful because of it.\"Die Hard\" is a terrific example of what happens when all the pieces of a film fall together perfectly.  There simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film.  Is \"Die Hard\" one of the best overall movies ever made?  Probably not.  But it\\'s undeniably one of the best action movies ever made, and it just might well be the perfect modern action film.  Grade: A',\n",
       " \"The Martian is a new Ridley Scott classic, featuring his best work in years, the best performance I've ever seen from Matt Damon, an outstanding supporting cast, a surprisingly funny screenplay from Daredevil creator Drew Goddard, and a great narrative that ties the film together beautifully. As expected with Ridley Scott films, the film itself is visually stunning. The landscape of Mars looks absolutely breathtaking, and the scenes aboard the Hermes and back on Earth are just as sharp in detail and scope. The way he chose to make this film made it almost seem like an exceptionally made biopic. Many times during this film, I legitimately believed that Mark Watney was a real, living person that was actually stranded on Mars for many months alone. It's Cast Away meets Apollo 13, and this marriage is crafted beautifully. Matt Damon is absolutely brilliant in this film. He plays Watney with so much optimism that it actually makes the depressing aspect of the film not as depressing for me. However, when he has to put on his dramatic chops in certain scenes, he truly commits to the drama of the situation, and that right there is true Ridley Scott suspense for you. The supporting cast, everyone involved, all do great work as well. Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, particularly Chiwetel Ejiofor. He is one of the best actors working today, and this movie and 12 Years a Slave shows how far he's come. The most surprisingly element about this movie though was the screenplay. The film is hilarious in some parts, in fact I'd argue that it's funnier than most comedies that have come out this year. What makes to movie unique to me was Watney's optimistic point of view. He believes that he isn't going to die on Mars, and this transforms this rather depressing situation into something comical instead. But when you really think about it, this is a very personal film about some people coming together to save somebody. That's it. And in today's world, it's nice to hear an story about people coming together to save one of their own. I have nothing bad to say about The Martian. It's the best film I've seen all year.\",\n",
       " 'I asked a friend to describe The Truman Show.  He said, \"No, it\\'s not a comedy, well...not exactly.\"  I didn\\'t quite understand until I watched it myself.  Truman takes on a tone quite different than any parody/comedies I\\'ve seen lately.  The point (the media and its destructive powers)  is subtlely relayed through dark humor, and you don\\'t feel like the director is smashing you over the head with his morals.  Peter Weir demonstrated his artistic genius in Dead Poets Society and here as well. The soundtrack is great, Ed Harris is stellar (what were they THINKING at the Academy?) and for once I actually liked Jim Carrey. His performance wasn\\'t ribald for once. The final scene--I will not reveal it--is a majestic, long-awaited finish to an intellectual movie. Some people will insist that it was boring or pointless.  Those are the same viewers who prefer slapstick, obvious humor to the subtle layers presented here.  This is a thinking person\\'s movie.  If you can\\'t see the underlying message here, of course you won\\'t like it!',\n",
       " 'I hate romantic comedies. I detest them. You can list the actors I avoid watching: Hugh Grant, Sandra Bullock, Richard Gere, Julia Roberts. Romantic comedies make me cringe and I avoid them like the plague so you can imagine the foul mood I was in when I was forced to watch this film.And the introductory voice-over by Hugh Grant as we watch an airport full of people hugging made me want to commit an act of violence - either against the people who forced me to watch this film or against myself just to end the torture.Then the most unbelievably shocking thing happened. Bill Nighy and Gregor Fischer came on screen, mocking one of the most hated love songs in Britain, \"Love is all Around\" and I found myself getting sucked into the film.By the time I reached the end of the film I found myself facing the impossible, there was one romantic comedy out there that genuinely is a comedy and actually likeable. No-one was more shocked than I.Many different kinds of love are covered (although not all kinds), there\\'s 8 storylines and the biggest cast list I\\'ve seen in a long time. Somehow, it works. You\\'d think it wouldn\\'t, I know I certainly didn\\'t.\\nIf you\\'re looking for a full-length story, this is not the film for you. It snap-shots the important events leading to the resolution of the couples involved, nothing more. If you want a classic romantic film, this might not be the film for you. This is funnier than most straight comedies I\\'ve seen in recent times, however (I\\'m just as harsh a critic of comedy films as I am of romantic films).It\\'s not trying to be the meaning of life, it\\'s not trying to look at the big picture. In fact, it\\'s only trying to do one thing, and that\\'s say positive feelings crop up in the most unexpected places or are more prevalent than people think. One of the storylines, one that is cited constantly in reviews as one of the failed storylines with a sad ending is actually bittersweet. It doesn\\'t end with failure but the failure of one type of love in favour of a different kind.This film isn\\'t perfect, I\\'ll never find the perfect romantic-comedy because I hate the genre so much, for example, one of the storylines did annoy me intensely and yet ironically still made me laugh in places. However, the flaws in the film are vastly outweighed by positives. It\\'s superficially complicated but is really a very simple film.  It makes a statement: \"love actually is all around\" then shows why it makes that statement and doesn\\'t attempt to do or be anything else.And like the fact it covers different kinds of love, it covers different attitudes and portrayals of it - so a couple are realistic, a couple are classic fantasy, a couple are pure comedy and a couple are pure rom-com tradition.I have seen no reviewer give this film a middle-of-the-road review, and I\\'ve read many reviews. I think, in the end, Love Actually is up to the individual. It\\'s like Marmite. You either love it or you hate it.Speaking as a cynical, misanthropic, Marmite-hating, Romantic-Comedy hating member of the human race, I actually liked Love Actually.',\n",
       " \"It appears most people find this movie to be sick, pointless, and without substance. That's unfair.This is the strongest movie I've ever seen, and it made an IMPORTANT impression on me, a big horrorflick-devotee. It made me question a lot of things about former favourite films, and made me realize how sick it is to make horror and violence into entertainment. The problem with most movies is that violence is not portrayed violent enough, horror isn't portrayed horrible enough. Most 'thriller' films have these ingredients softened so that people can enjoy it, and THAT'S sick. This movie is SANE. It shows horror and violence as it IS - totally revolting and disgusting.I sat as on needles for 1 hour 40 minutes, and felt really bad watching this film. It grossed me out, but I understood why this film is both good and important. It gives a sane perspective on violence, as opposed to SICK, SICK Hollywood-action where people get killed by 'heroes' and nobody raises an eyebrow.\",\n",

You can actually smell the place. Extraordinary. I\\'m not going to reveal anything about the story - Gian Luigi Rondi a legendary Italian film critic, revealed the ending to a television audience, what was he thinking?! - The film will be enjoyed much more allowing the story to unfold without having passages underlined and attention drawn to this or that particular.

       " \"I had the honour of attending the world premiere of this film tonight. I think at this point it would be pretty hard to argue that 'Saw' is the most consistent horror series ever made. To be 10 films in and still putting out masterpieces is something we really shouldn't take for granted. And 'Saw X' is a masterpiece in my opinion. This film was everything I wanted and more.The motivations of John Kramer and whether they are justified or not has always been a great discussion among horror lovers and 'Saw' fans alike. This film is very aware of that. It makes multiple references to this debate and they are done in a way that is both slightly tongue in cheek and also deadly serious coming out of the mouth of Kramer.This film is a little different to others in the series however. This time we have a revenge plot and no matter where you stand on Kramer, he is likely going to be your undisputed protagonist here. I thought the revenge element was a brilliant addition to the series. It adds another layer to the depravity that we are witnessing and makes everything so much more layered.The movie is probably the most patient in terms of set up the series has seen yet. It takes quite a while for the movie to get all its ducks in a row and get down to the nitty gritty business. Once it does though it is relentless the second half of the film moves at an electric pace.This film was incredible. I couldn't have asked for more. 10/10.\",\n",
       " 'I laughed so hard I spit out half the bucket-o-pop I was drinking, and finally had to stop sipping from its fine nectar, because so many times I was hooting and bending over in joy.There are some slower moments to let you catch your breath and allow for moments of sincerity, but only for a minute. The scenes in the previews (the ones you think will ruin the movie for you) are expounded on ten-fold, so there are plenty of surprises.During the movie I kept saying, \"This is me and my friends when we were in high school!\" They were almost the same conversations about life, sex and girls; just not as frequently, but it\\'s only a two-hour film. Any guy will appreciate American Pie full tilt, and girls will realize just what hoops guys jump through in order to get their attention, let alone in their pants.What added to American Pie is that I liked every character, because the filmmakers didn\\'t feel the urge to give us prototypical teen characters. Their personalities are distinctive, and their situations are all different, which leads to a hilarious finale where we see just how their pact plays out on prom night.As I mentioned before, there are genuine moments on the screen where the guys and gals have revelations of sincerity. It adds a needed depth to a film like this, where it\\'s not just raw, raunchy comedy, but important to the lives of the characters who know more than sex is at stake. Which is another reason to like Pie, there are several slices, and sexual conquest is only one of them.',\n",
       " \"Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. If there's anything I can say, it's that it is the best superhero movie I have seen. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character. Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. The film's unlikely hero is Quill (Chris Pratt), an eccentric gunfighter in the Han Solo mould who we meet stealing a metal orb coveted by the evil warlord Ronan. When he dispatches his top assassin, the green- skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), to recover the artifact, the pair find themselves locked up, along with the galaxy's most unlikely bounty hunters – a gun-toting raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick (Vin Diesel) who just happens to be a walking tree. All the actors do a great job at portraying there characters, they feel real beings. You get to know about them and their struggles and you become attached to them. Every character in the movie got their time to shine, especially Rocket Raccoon who is voiced perfectly by Bradley Cooper. Everyone is pitch perfect in their roles even Batista! For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well. What really can't be stressed enough is just how insanely fun and entertaining Guardians of the Galaxy is for literally its entire two-hour-plus run-time.

       " \"First off, I was quite surprised to see the cinema so full for this movie, even on opening weekend. I guess not that many movies for women in their 30's plus exist these days!I expected this movie, as I'm sure many people did, to be a Fatal Attraction but with the genders switched around.I was pleasantly surprised and shocked by it NOT being what I expected, and I definitely enjoyed it alot more than Fatal Attraction.The summary of this movie is that Diane Lane's character starts cheating on her husband (Richard Gere) with a beautiful French man(Olivier Martinez). Everything else should be left for surprise.The pacing of this movie is perfect. We got a sense of Connie and Edward's home life before she met the dashing Paul. They have a darling son, Charlie, who adds alot of humour to the movie, but in a non precocious way. After the affair starts we see Connie's feelings range from excitement to complete disgust with herself. And of course Edward inevitably finds out. His reaction is interesting, to say the least, and perhaps very honest.\\nThe acting is great, especially from Diane Lane. The sex scenes are pretty raunchy, and made me uncomfortable at certain points, but it's interesting to see how different sex with the lover and sex with the husband were.At the end of this movie I didn't feel cheated or robbed with some contrived ending (although others may argue differently). This film dealt with how being in an affair must feel, and how finding out you're being cheated on could make your react in uncharacteristic ways.As a movie critic said, this movie will indeed make you never have an affair!\",\n",
       " \"Saw this last night. Set at a Wall Street firm on the night in 2008 when the leaders realize that changes in the market will wipe them out if they don't immediately stop selling the products that have been making them all rich, the movie centers on the moral dilemma - recognized by some characters but dismissed by others - that they face in unwinding their positions, saving themselves but shifting the pain to others.The movie finds a way to hold the mirror up to our civilization, showing how we are all complicit in a collective 'dream' (one character says at one point, in response to another who says he feels like he is in a 'dream', 'Funny, it seems like I just woke up'). The dream is the illusion of easy, risk-managed wealth that the financial markets manufacture, again and again, since the emergence of capital markets 200 years ago, until the illusion morphs overnight into a panic. Reality intervenes, fear takes over, and the 'survivor' is the guy who first reaches the lifeboat. So there are no villains in this movie, just people, richly drawn, beautifully acted characters realized by some of our best actors who relish the opportunity to show what they can do given a killer script and enough screen time between lines to actually be the people they are portraying. Central to the movie's success: 1) It gets across the essence of what is going on in the financial markets without bogging us down or dumbing it down2) finding a moral question that can be resolved in a night, yet which is nevertheless a perfect allegory for the whole set of moral questions raised by an economy that works the way ours does, rewarding false confidence, recklessness, and deceit as often as industry, skill, and integrity3) the placement of young, innocent but perceptive characters at the center of the drama, who function as our eyes and ears, who are like stand-ins for all of us who weren't there, at the heart of the dream machine, when the latest fantasy of easy wealth was exposed as a collective delusion4) really 'gets' the trader ethos and manner - they are a kind of warrior caste, foul-mouthed, impulsive, deeply selfish, surviving by their ability to outplay their counterparts, and yet living by a warrior code that sets boundaries on what they will and will not do to one another (having spent three years on Wall Street several panics ago, it rang as true as any movie I have seen on the subject)It's like Mamet, except you don't have to work as hard to figure out what everyone's up to. It's like Chinatown, except the 'crime' is something far worse than molesting a single young girl. These guys f****d the entire planet, for Ch*****sake. It's like the best movie I've seen in a little while.What an incredibly sure hand from a director on his maiden voyage! Who is this guy? Whoever you are, please don't stop. I would pay a lot to see what he could do with topics like 'the decision to go to war', or 'the emergence of China/India/Brazil/Indonesia from poverty to global player'. Hell I would go see him revive Mother Goose, after this debut.I'll calm down now. Enjoy.\",\n",
       " \"I think half the people writing negative reviews on this movie are just Nicola haters. Nicola brought many great actors together to create her vision and I thought it was amazing and captured the message perfectly. Her character was especially inspiring and moving. I love that Raven got to showcase her acting skills as well as she is so funny! I hope people give the movie a chance and don't judge just because a rich person is starring in it. Loooots of rich people play roles that don't represent them, so don't be turned off because of what others are saying. The sad truth is this story depicts many people's lives.\",\n",
       " \"There came a point, about half way through this film, when I emerged from the world of wonder on screen, took stock of my emotions in that instant, and realized that yes, by God, I am LOVING this movie.I didn't really expect to, of course -- although certainly, I hoped for it. With such an incredible cast, an able director at the helm, a story of Bryan Singer provenance and the inclusion of some of my favorite, if lesser known, X-types (Darwin! Tempest! Havok!), I was eager to see this beloved band of merry Marvel mutants redeem themselves after the massive failures of X3 and X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE.Which they do. And how!One thing that the avid comic fan must do when approaching this movie, however, is to divorce themselves utterly from almost all established four-color X-Men continuity. Oh, some bears up, but by and large this is a whole new origin story, a reboot of epic proportions, and yet it is a retcon so cleverly done, and one that offers up a such a delicious mélange of complex relationships and sensible motivation, that all of the many discrepancies inherent in having Mystique on the side of good or having Moira McTaggert a CIA agent simply do not matter. Speaking of McTaggert, Rose Byrne is both comely and convincing in the role, and almost every other actor is perfectly, one might almost say forcefully, cast. McAvoy brings a kind of laddish charm to Charles Xavier that he mixes nicely with both decency and naïveté, and Michael Fassbender's nascent Magneto is relentlessly, even heart-breakingly, compelling. Their chemistry is electric -- theirs' is one of the most multi-faceted and sincere bromances the screen has seen in a good long while.The younger cast all impress, though particular praise must go to Oscar-nominee Jennifer Lawrence as the petulant but pitiable Raven/Mystique (The Academy Awards have been good to young, hot X-chicks; let us not forget that Rogue herself, Anna Paquin, won for THE PIANO). Former child star Nicholas Hoult is also outstanding as the troubled Hank McCoy, and perhaps the most surprising kudos must go to teenage dream Lucas Till, who conveys the particular anti-social asshole-hood of the turbulent Alex Summers very convincingly indeed.The biggest letdown in the movie, acting-wise, is January Jones as Emma Frost. True, she is appropriately ravishing, there can be no denying that, but she lacks the\\x85 the zing of the written character. There is very little intelligence, snark, or even personality behind her interpretation of this most intriguing of mutants; she's just kind of Stand There and Look Pretty -- which, for one playing Emma Frost, is something a travesty.The only other weight under which this movie really labors is the fact that it is a prequel, and it therefore suffers from the feeling of inevitability that besets all such endeavors. Anakin Skywalker HAS to go Dark Side. Bilbo Baggins HAS to find the One Ring. And Magneto HAS to turn against humans; Mystique HAS to join him; Xavier HAS to end up in a wheelchair. With these definite plot developments looming, their eventuation is bound to be a bit of an anti-climax.And yet the fun part about X-MEN: FIRST CLASS is the journey it takes us on to get us there. Offering up plenty of surprises, some kickass action sequences, mighty fine special effects, sly humor and a killer cameo, it is without doubt the best comic book movie of the year – nay, decade – thus far. And considering how overcrowded that list is, this is really saying Something.Huh. A prequel that does not, in any way, suck.Amazing, isn't it?-- Rachel Hyland, geekspeakmagazine.com\",\n",
       " \"This is the first time I commented on a film. I saw this yesterday night for the first time. And I just cried.I cried for Jim. I cried for the pain our country caused in the innocent civilians. (Japan can be so stupid!) I cried for the pilots of the Zero-sen.I've read and seen lots of movies of these pilots. They're called tokoutai in Japanese. They get on their planes knowing they will die. It's a suicide mission, and they were very proud of it. I know if you're on the winning side you may not sympathize these pilots, but they were just fighting for their country. In those days, the emperor was everything. They taught you to die for the emperor at school when you were only in 1st grade.But I don't know the war. I've never experienced it. I can't understand the concept of dying for your emperor. So I sympathise with Jim. Jim is a symbol. A symbol of innocence, of the horrors of war. His singing proves that too. He's also the ray of light for these prisoners. His energy and vitality are important aspects. It brings out some human characteristics in the sergent as well.Christian Bale was remarkable. He should be commemorated or something for this performance, cause it was just brilliant. So was John Malcovich.Overall it was great. One of the best movies I ever saw. It made me think, a lot. About war, about Japan, about history, and about humans in general.\",\n",

       " 'Comedy is tragedy + time, right? We\\'re now over 7 years out from the apex of the American financial crisis, which spiraled outward across the world, and yet what has really changed? People are still making millions/billions off the suffering of others, corporate control reigns supreme, fraud is common and remains largely unknown, wealth continues to be ever more concentrated in the grasp of a few, and the remainder of the populace are treated as proverbial rats and made to feel uncouth should they question the system and question not wanting to live their lives playing this sadistic game. Taking 2 pennies and selling them to someone for a hundred dollars remains a legal activity, just call those pennies by a different name and suddenly it\\'s okay to pass them off as fair market.It doesn\\'t sound funny at all, but The Big Short succeeds in turning this demented and corrupt circus into something improbably hilarious and probing. The power of comedy is its ability to let us see something from a different viewpoint, allow us to process it in ways we wouldn\\'t have been able to otherwise. As we might laugh at children for the hilariously unaware things they say and do, so too will humankind in the future hopefully laugh at how completely pathetic and ignorant our present society has been. Martin Scorsese opened the flap up into the circus entrance with \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and, while making good points, was perhaps a bit too concerned with his own technique and had a bit too much indulgence, reveling in the frivolity of it all. The Big Short completely blows the top of the circus and dissects it in every way, starting with the widespread fraud and greed in business, and then examining how it has seeped into our entire existences. Even the good guys here are ultimately out there to make money, lots of it. Isn\\'t that what society tells us we must to do, in order to be valuable? It\\'s sick.McKay\\'s approach here is \"throw everything in, including the kitchen sink\" and that creates an energetic, brilliantly matched representation of the subject matter. This does not mean he is lacking control, however. The story being told includes so many facets and characters that it easily could have fallen into disarray, but McKay makes every single character memorable and illuminates every piece of jargon that could be confusing from the outset. It\\'s a huge accomplishment and a far more important one than might seem apparent. The things that were allowed to happen in the realms of business, finance, and banking are absolutely INSANE and unbelievable. It has to be largely comedic because there\\'s no other way of delivering this vast amount of information and complete failure of our entire society and make it all snap into place so continuously, without being ripped apart by the overwhelming darkness of it all. This isn\\'t simply circumstantial and theoretical and mysterious to a degree, as in Oliver Stone\\'s \"JFK\", but the cold hard truth.It\\'s not enough to even ask for the truth anymore and ask for answers, we need to question the entire system, a whole web of poisonous bonds that have tightly wound themselves so entirely around us. The work of the film itself is allowing us to project our thoughts, our fears, our anger, and our confusions into this convoluted conundrum. All while being told the truth, so that we at least have a place to even start down the correct path of understanding. It\\'s acting as our own investigative journey in a time when actual news and journalism has become a tiny spec of its former self. We now have more information than ever available to us, yet it\\'s often so shrouded and twisted as to become unrecognizable. There are still those who fear education for what it would do to their own position in life, how it would challenge their own reality. We are still held under the thumb of \"greed is good\", \"thinking you\\'re inherently better is good\", \"vanity is good\".The shiny mainstream hallmarks of a typical Hollywoood commercial product - the agreeable lighting and manicured actors and tidy locations - are so perfectly representative in this film of the emptiness within the characters and indeed in our entire society. After all the progress we think we\\'ve made towards world peace and human rights and medical advances and the stability of the human race, have we lost sight of what a fulfilling life and a world of justice should really be? Aren\\'t we still captive to the same pointless rituals and superficialities, doesn\\'t a veritable monarch and royal court still control most everything? We are now living our lives working for something that can be wiped out with the stroke of a keyboard. We are told something of monetary worth that is non-existent, for all intents and purposes, is something we should strive for. Making a bet on the outcome of another bet is a whole industry. The non-existent and ridiculous and pointless directly hurts the lives of many.The Big Short is one of the most important films of this era and one of the best. I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. It is an illumination, a magical pairing of a director\\'s sensibility to exactly the correct form that most fully allows it to blossom and hold water. It is water which the film warns us will be the next basic human necessity to be denied by those few who hold power.',\n",

       " 'Scenario 1: If you are going to see this film because you really enjoy classic Godzilla movies and you hope the music and campy theme of those films are represented in this one, you absolutely should go see it. Godzilla here looks much more like the beloved behemoth than it did in the \\'98 movie, the music hearkens to the classic Japanese overtures of the old Gojira film era, and the camera work has the comically silly nature of Sam Rami\\'s Spiderman series.Scenario 2: If you are really excited to see a deep, human film with camera angles and writing that really tell a story that is thematically transcendent such as \"District 9\" and the Korean film \"The Host,\" this is not your film. The script is filled with overtly simplistic rhetoric and one dimensional characters (intentionally,) the scenes somehow manage to have very little tension (even for me, the pilot episodes for most sitcoms seem more tense than Gozilla,) and as stated above, the camera-work is intentionally hammy. It should also be noted that to add a human element, the director overuses children to the point that it ends up feeling very obvious, as though he did it to be intentionally campy.Scenario 3: If you are one of those people who really just want a fun popcorn flick such as Pacific Rim, with some solidly choreographed action like in the over-the-top bulletfest Battle:LA, I would say proceed with caution. The fight scenes are less intense and more majestic, like any classic monster movie, and as such the human aspect of the combat is relatively insignificant, less so than any other monster movie I\\'ve ever seen. There are no little monsters for anyone to shoot at, if that\\'s your thing.Scenario 4: If you are interested in this film because you love the talented work of Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, and/or Aaron Taylor- Johnson (three of my favorite actors) and are excited to see what they bring to the table, you should probably sit this one out. Bryan Cranston\\'s role in this film garners far less screen time than advertised, Ken Watanabe spends literally every second walking through the scenes with the pained expression of someone who just walked in on their parents, and all three of the actors give off the vibe that they are very much aware of how cheesy their lines are. Everyone else\\'s performance was similarly forgettable.Honestly, I\\'m a stickler for deep, human storytelling, but I\\'ve also had a softspot for the classic, silly fun of many Godzilla movies, including my favorite, Godzilla vs. Destroyah.

       " \"The Little Mermaid (2023) is a movie that my daughter and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows a mermaid princess obsessed with the surface and humans. When a Prince's boat crashes and she saves him she becomes even more obsessed with him and the ways of humans against her father's advice. She makes a deal with a sea witch to become human for three days but if the prince doesn't kiss her in that time, she will return to the ocean to be the witch's slave forever. Can the mermaid uncover the ways of the humans and find true love?This movie is directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago) and stars Halle Bailey (Last Holiday), Jonah Hauer-King (A Dog's Way Home), Melissa McCarthy (The Heat), Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Man), Noma Dumezweni (Dirty Pretty Things) and Awkwafina (Crazy Rich Asians).This live action remake is beautifully executed with tremendous CGI, storytelling and use of color. Seeing this in 3D was a treat too. The storyline aligned to this animated film perfectly with some good additions. I loved the depiction of the island life and struggles of the humans and mermaids and their mutual perception of each other. I did miss the cook from the cartoon. The new songs were hit or miss. I can't say I enjoyed Eric's song, Halle's new songs worked and I actually enjoyed the rap. The back and forth between Sebastian and Scuttle was hilarious and well written. Melissa McCarthy was a fantastic Ursula and how she was depicted was perfect, especially at the very end.Overall, this is one of the best Disney live action remakes. I would score this a strong 8-8.5/10 and strongly recommend it.\",\n",
       " 'Words cannot express how much I hated this movie. I hated every aspect of it, from the direction to the writing to the acting. Havoc is the story of one teenager\\'s (Anne Hathaway) exploration of a world outside that which she is accustomed. And that\\'s putting it in a way that gives this movie more credit than it deserves. Hathaway\\'s character is part of a \"gang\" of white, upper-class high-schoolers who backlash at their upbringing by emulated black culture. She and her friends eventually decide to take a trip to East L.A., and no hilarity ensues.I decided to watch this movie for two reasons: Stephen Gaghan had a hand in it; and Anne Hathaway, who I have always found enjoyable to watch, was starring in it.I\\'ll begin my criticism with the writing. After finally viewing the movie, I can honestly say that I found nothing that resembles Stephen Gaghan in the script. Vapid is the only word I can think of to describe the thoughts and ideas of this movie. It is one of the those movies that tries so hard to make a social comment, yet fails so miserably. The characters are all one-dimensional, especially Toby (Mike Vogel), the wigger boyfriend of Hathaway\\'s character Allison. His actions are so broad and exaggerated, I had a hard time taking anything he, or anyone on screen at the time, did seriously. Finally, each character was written to be an example of a stereotype. I almost laughed when Hector (Freddy Rodriguez) tried to explain that not everything in East L.A. was about gangs and drugs, then proceeded to fill every stereotype of a movie gang member. Each and every actor in this movie lost points in my book for being associated with this film. Even those I like and respect. Michael Biehn, Laura San Giacomo, Anne Hathaway and Bijou Phillips all have done serious, believable roles. Even Joseph Gordon-Levitt, whose only respectable role I\\'ve seen him in was \"10 Things I Hate About You\" (I haven\\'t seen \"Manic\" as of this writing), in which he was at least believable. Here, his unbelievable overacting reaches a point at which Paris Hilton would be proud. This brings me to the directing. Because I respect many of the leads and they have done great work in the past, I can only blame the awful choices on the director. Very few movies reach the depths this movie does. I have not hated a movie so much since \"The Doom Generation.\" Stay away if you can.',\n",
       " 'There are not enough words in the English language to describe the praise Darren Aronofsky deserves for Black Swan. It was one of the most talked about and sought after films at this year\\'s Toronto International Film Festival (which I managed to snag a ticket for), and for good reason – it is a masterpiece that is just as much beautiful as it is nightmarish.Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) has toiled for years within a New York ballet company, always pushing herself. The company has fallen under hard times, and director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) makes the swift decision to put on a new rendition of the classic Swan Lake. With the company\\'s go-to lead pushed into retirement, Nina is quickly selected to be the lead in the new ballet. With competition arriving in the form of new dancer Lily (Mila Kunis), and the demanding desire for perfection from both Thomas and her overbearing mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), Nina begins a journey into dark uncharted territory.Black Swan is an enthralling and visceral experience from beginning to end. Aronofsky has used what he has learned from making the raw and unflinching The Wrestler and the cerebral horror and incredibly disturbing Requiem for a Dream, and has crafted a film that you will simply not be able to take your eyes off of. He builds up rather slow, but right after that first moment of off-the-rails insanity, he delivers one hell of an incredible piece of cinema. One that is not easily able to be classified to any one genre.While you may have read suggestions that Black Swan and The Wrestler are two halves of the same film, make no mistake at looking at it any further beyond the comparison of being about two people toiling within two very different forms of art. Black Swan is never a low budget character piece. It is a film that navigates between being thrilling and horrific at the same time. While the horror elements start to take more prominence in the second half (specifically the rather squeamish elements of body horror, done in a way that would make David Cronenberg proud), the film never lets one completely overtake the other. It manages to maintain this sense of dread, darkness and rather graphic wound/injury infliction throughout.The visuals and editing are the drive of what helps make the film so well done. Contrasting blacks and whites so frequently give the obvious hints of good and evil, innocence and darkness. But Aronofsky likes to throw in hints of ambiguity at every turn, changing the colours for each character depending on the scene, and depending on what they may or may not be doing. Even the scenery and set design is in plain black and whites, always making the audience guess the true motivations and intentions of both character and creator. Adding in the element of reflection, both in others and the self (mostly through mirrors), only helps compound these feelings of ambiguity and confusion. It will consistently keep audiences thinking about what is being shown and what is actually going on. The subtle visual effects and astoundingly well done score only help add to the greatness.Aronofsky also deserves recognition for the film\\'s lean running time. When so many films are often far too long and dragged out, this film maintains a sense of momentum that never gets lost at any point. The film\\'s slow points are never dragged out, merely well padded out for the shift from Nina being innocent to adrenaline soaked horror as she descends into the realm of darkness. Rather gracefully, Aronofsky manages to balance the goal of Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin\\'s script to blend Nina\\'s tale with the story of Swan Lake itself, and never loses sight or direction at any instance. This is bravado style filmmaking at its finest, and more than suggests that the brilliant direction in Requiem for a Dream was not a fluke.Portman, who has shown her acting merits before in the likes of Closer, delivers a startlingly intense and beautiful performance as Nina. At once you can see the innocent, sexually repressed little girl who just wants to please her mother, and the sexually depraved fallen angel, inching closer towards independence and adulthood. She is very clearly not \"well\" in the beginning of the film, and as the film progresses, you can practically chart her 180-degree reversal in character. She is downright terrifying in many instances, and more than proves her worth as an actress. When she finally dons makeup late in the film, her transformation from a once promising talent to a full blown powerhouse talent becomes simply marvelous to watch.The supporting cast only helps to further complement Portman\\'s extraordinary performance. Cassel is amazing as always as the slimy and twisted Thomas. We never really get more than hints at his true intentions, but Cassel makes every moment on-screen simply amazing. Kunis delivers a level of depth I never thought was possible for her. She commands the screen with every new scene, and this performance will easily act as a starmaking role for her. Hershey is even better; practically stealing the screen away from Portman\\'s magnetizing performance. She makes Erica into that monster of a character everyone loves to hate, and brings a level of intensity to every mere moment she appears in. If anyone is even nearly close to equaling Portman\\'s performance, it would be her. Despite only appearing for a few minutes, Winona Ryder is amazing in her role as the former lead ballerina Beth. I just wish she could have chewed up more scenery.Black Swan is an incredible film from beginning to end, and will not easily leave you. It is a masterpiece of unheralded success, and is easily the best film I saw at TIFF. Watch out for it at Oscar time – it just may steal the show.10/10.',\n",

So I thought I would visit IMDB and see what others had to say. I learned four things;1/ This movie was a flop at the box office. Funny, I had always assumed it was a hit \\x96 it was so good, and spawned three (soon to be four) sequels and a television series.2/ I expected some to be less than entranced with Highlander, but was interested to learn that there are those who think it complete rubbish.3/ Some people think the sequels are good movies. How could they?4/ Some people don't like the Queen soundtrack. How could they not?It is always interesting to see different viewpoints, especially when they are completely contrary to your own. But for me, this movie was perfect. The premise was intriguing, the story was beautifully told, the joy and pathos of an immortal amongst mortals revealed with great skill. There was great action, romance, the tragedy of love lost \\x96 and the baddest of bad guys to overcome.The casting was excellent, as was the acting. Sean Connery's contribution was exactly as it should have been, and no more. Clancy Brown's performance as The Kurgan was joyfully terrifying, Christopher Lambert was spot-on.The screenplay was excellent, as was the script. I was especially impressed with the way that flashbacks were interwoven with the ongoing story. In fact, this is the only flashback movie I have ever liked.I was also thoroughly impressed with the action sequences. Unlike so many recent movies, none of the action involved the physically impossible (with the obvious exception of the fact that the immortals were immortal, of course). This added enormously to the appeal, in direct contrast to so many movies made in the last decade. I despair when I watch movies where people perform the impossible. Even the classic scene `Oh, I'm falling \\x96 but it's OK, I can just grab this rope/branch/flagpole/whatever, and even though I have fallen 30 feet and am travelling at 20 mph, I can just stretch out my hand and arrest my fall as though I was no heavier than a feather' destroys all credibility in the action. I know, this is a fantasy movie anyway, so what does it matter? Well, realistic action is even more important in fantasy movies; it helps the audience to willingly suspend disbelief. This is very difficult to do when you are busy giggling at the latest fantastical feat you have witnessed. No such concerns in this movie \\x96 the action was perfectly judged to reflect the prowess gained from centuries of experience, whilst avoiding the impossible and the ridiculous.I was intrigued to find one user comment on IMDB criticising the use of `unnecessarily large and heavy weapons'. Anyone who has used (or even picked up) any edged weapon will be aware that they are very heavy. Moving that kind of mass means lots of momentum, and involves very distinctive body movements to counterbalance the weight. Most movies use toy weapons \\x96 plastic, fibreglass or wood \\x96 and the lack of mass shows in the actor's movements. For the uninitiated, this may make for flashier and faster action \\x96 but for those who know, it looks like children playing pretend. The use of weapons with real weight in Highlander adds tremendously to the realism. It was particularly impressive that the actors could use the weapons properly (at least to the extent demanded by the choreographed scenes \\x96 and that is all that is required for movies). Clancy Brown (as The Kurgan) deserves special praise here \\x96 he had the largest and heaviest weapon, yet wielded it like a veteran. One can only imagine the endless hours he spent perfecting his movements and balance.I do understand why some would find the soundtrack intrusive, but for me this was another area that was perfectly judged. Queen's songs enhanced the mood of the moment whenever they played. One related fact that some might find interesting \\x96 a few years ago I saw a list of the top ten best movies for music as voted for by students. Highlander made the list \\x96 the only non-musical to do so. (In fact, I think it came in the top five.) So I would guess that the soundtrack works for most people..I also understand why the accents in the movie (Christopher Lambert's and Sean Connery's) are a problem for some. However, I was happy with Lambert's accent; it was Scottish enough for the Highland scenes, and suitably indefinable for the modern settings. Sean Connery was, of course, Sean Connery \\x96 he never adopts any accent other than his own. But that's OK \\x96 it doesn't detract from the film, any more than it detracts from any of his films (such as Red October). I tend to agree with his point that accents don't matter \\x96 emotions are the same, regardless of nationality.\\nJust a quick word about the sequels \\x96 disappointing. I am not one to decry all sequels as inferior. In fact, many sequels are very good, and some are better than their progenitors. However, the Highlander sequels were without exception very poor. The original film was obviously conceived as a one-off, and was all the better for it. The story was complete with Highlander, and the sequels were necessarily contrived. However, Highlander II exceeded all expectations in this regard. The plot changed the story of the immortals beyond all recognition. Egregious just isn't a big enough word to describe it.The sequels are best viewed as being entirely separate from the original. If you haven't already seen them, be prepared for a decidedly tepid experience.But Highlander itself \\x96 ah, there's a real movie. Sit back and enjoy!\\n9.5/10\",\n",
       " \"When I first saw The Sixth Sense, I didn't know what to expect. I guess I was looking forward to a good scary horror flick.  I was very surprised. I found that the purpose for this movie was far greater than just trying to scare the audience.  I found this movie was showing not only the emotions of fear, but also faith, commitment, sadness of loss, and love.  The end was so surprising, I had to see it again.  The second time I watched it, I did it from a totally different perspective (this is a very rare quality for any movie), and I enjoyed it just as much, or maybe even more. I also, as many viewers have, tried to detect fallacies in the story.  I couldn't find one. In addition, for those that appreciate great soundtracks, the music only helps to heighten the experience of the movie.\\nI believe that a great movie is one that helps the viewer perceive life and the world differently.  The Sixth Sense is one of those extraordinary movies that does that to me.  This movie reflects on some difficult subjects that will make the viewer walk away asking eternal questions.  Questions about death, about letting go, about eternal love and commitment, about the love between parent and child, and between husband and wife.  Maybe I read too much into this very wonderful film, but I believe it will be difficult to find a movie that has touched on these subjects so poignantly and so well for years to come.\",\n",

Even though Daniel, Rupert and Emma are much older than 14 (it's pretty obvious) they are so convincing as they learn about their feelings of maturity:) The selection ceremony for the Tri-Wizard tournament was humorous. The look of shock on certain characters faces is unforgettable! The tasks are fun and exciting even though I already knew what was going to happen! I thought that the Yule ball was absolutely spectacular, and Ron's dress robes were awesome! The movie was so well done, I'd have to say that it is the best movie in the series so far! The movie does the book justice.\",\n",
       " \"I had fearful reservations about this one. I loved Tim Burton's Batman - 12 years old when it came out I was the perfect age for it and I also enjoyed Batman Returns. The franchise went so wrong under Joel Schumacher that I wasn't sure I wanted it resurrected. Not least because Batman was one of the few comics I read and enjoyed as a kid and was always my favourite superhero. I grew up reading the comics, watching reruns of the Adam West TV show and then getting Burton's celluloid vision. I was spoilt for choice as a kid but as an adult now I was concerned revisiting the franchise, especially given Warner's record over the last decade of screwing up summer blockbusters with potential all over the place (dare I bring up the Matrix sequels?)However, I am pleased to report I could not have been more wrong about how great Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is. This is better than Burton. Sacrilege, you say?! Well Burton was still cartoony in many elements, he wasn't churning out the bilge of Schumacher but Burton's Batman was still over the top. As a kid this was ideal but Nolan's Batman is real. Everything in this world seems plausible and it is therefore a world that draws you in. Characters' vulnerability is that much more present. Every bruise, every scare, every concern, every emotion seems real.Part of this is that Nolan has assembled an exemplary cast. Again, this concerned me prior to seeing the film. I wasn't sure a cast of big name legends like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman and well known names like Liam Neeson and Katie Holmes wouldn't detract and distract from Batman. I was always sure Christian Bale could be the great moody Batman he's been waiting his career to be but the others I wasn't so sure about.That said Bale is not just good, he's superb. I never thought I'd really be able to envision anyone other than Michael Keaton as the definitive Batman for me but since seeing Batman Begins a couple of days ago Bale has cemented himself in the position. Perhaps Keaton will now be able to escape the spectre of Batman he hasn't truly shaken off for 13 years.The rest of the cast is also pitch perfect. Cillian Murphy is creepy as hell, Liam Neeson is authoritative and imposing, Katie Holmes is strong and sexy (I particularly thought she'd be insipid, she should jettison Tom Cruise and let her talent - which she does have naysayers just watch Pieces Of April - speak for itself) and Michael Caine is an Alfred you've never seen but in fact far more likely as a butler than the aristocratic pomp with which he is usually portrayed. Gary Oldman is also superb in a rare wholly decent character for him as Lieutenant Jim Gordon who gets far more to so here than Gordon has ever had to do before. Only Tom Wilkinson is a little off with a slightly comedic wise-guy American accent that never really convinces.The emotional bond between Bruce Wayne and Alfred is actually a wonderful human heart to the film than Nolan and Goyer have written perfectly.Don't let that make you think the action is not front and centre though. From Wayne's training through the early stages of the film to his early missions as Batman at about the half way point to a thrillingly choreographed chase sequence and an edge of your seat finale this film delivers the cool quotient in bucket loads.Great villains (especially Murphy), great story, great cast, great action... put simply, great film. Probably the best comic-book movie ever made (that's excluding the genius Sin City which I consider a moving comic-book rather than a comic-book movie, that will never be bettered but Batman is a different beast and the best of its kind).\",\n",
       " \"From the opening sex scene involving menstrual blood, this movie was distasteful and unpleasant. But it wasn't only the fluids that made it unpleasant, it was the soulless office scenes and the humorless vulgarity of the main characters. The lengthy conversations about finance in the office scenes were unintelligibly boring and the head honcho of the office was woefully miscast, looking more like a coarse manual laborer than a high powered executive. (And, yes, I know manual laborers are essential, but admit it, the images of executives and manual laborers are not interchangeable.) Emily and Luke, the main characters, cannot in any way be rooted for. The viewer is given nothing about them to care about so their relationship is ultimately unimportant to us.

       " '10/10Recently, I read an excerpt from a book by Dennis Lim called \"David Lynch: The Man from Another Place.\" In it, the author mentions how much Lynch despises interpretation of his work. He writes:\"Writing about David Lynch, it can be hard not to hear his voice in your head, protesting the violence being done to his work. \\'As soon as you put things in words, no one ever sees the film the same way,\\' he once told me. \\'And that\\'s what I hate, you know. Talking—it\\'s real dangerous.\\' Not for nothing does \"Mulholland Drive,\" the Lynch movie that has invited the most fervent flurry of explication, end with a word of caution: \\'Silencio.\\'\"This reminded me that 11 years before this edit I had written this very review on IMDb, which contained an interpretation of the film\\'s plot. I\\'ve decided to remove all of that. Whether or not you are satisfied with a particular interpretation of the plot should be irrelevant to your enjoyment of the film. I enjoyed it before I had that satisfying interpretation. And I\\'m hoping that I can clear it from my mind the next time I watch \"Mulholland Dr.\"I will leave one thing from my original post. A quote by Peter Greenaway. \"I would argue that if you want to write narratives, be an author, be a novelist, don\\'t be a film maker. Because I believe film making is so much more exciting in areas which aren\\'t primarily to do with narrative.\"',\n",
       " \"A Clockwork Orange is the finest film that has ever been made, in my view. Stanley Kubrick has made so many masterpieces, and is by far the best director that ever graced our world. A Clockwork Orange is simply his finest hour!The film grabs you and glues you to your seat from start to finish. Malcolm McDowell gives us a shining example of superior acting, and the movie is as perverted as any of Kubrick's masterpieces (and then some!). It contains horrifying violence, extreme emotions, perversity and weirdness at it's very worst. It all boils down to serve you a plethora of thoughts for you to take with you and contemplate, after the film ends.However, with all the perversity bursting out of this film, you will probably NOT like this film the first time you see it. I know I didn't. Fortunately, I gave it a second chance, and thought: Hey, it was actually not bad at all. After the third time, I was lost for words.After the fourth time, there was little doubt in my mind, that this was the finest film ever made, and regardless of how many great masterpieces I see, A Clockwork Orange still towers above them. I'm sure you'll agree, if you give it the chance it deserves, although it may require for you to see it more than once.\",\n",
       " \"I must admit, the trailers didn't have me convinced - and after the sour taste 'Jack the Giant Slayer' left in my mouth, I was sceptic. I really dug Matthew Vaughn's approach with 'First Class' (who had a tough task rebooting the franchise after the lacklustre 'Last Stand' and the generic, dull 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine') and I wouldn't have minded him returning at all. But as it turns out, Bryan Singer (yes, I dare speak his name) still has a few tricks up his sleeve. For its sheer scale and epic storytelling alone, 'Days of Future Past' is fantastic.It's a shame there's so much controversy surrounding this film, but I guess whoever chooses to deprive himself willingly of such a pleasure must be fully aware that he does so at his own expense. Because this is the kind of film that made me fall in love with movies in the first place.Yet (despite my 10-star review), it's not perfect. And it's not 'The Usual Suspects' with mutants - how could it be; this is simply not that kind of film. But I have to say that pretty much my only gripe with this movie is that it has too many characters and that some of them don't get enough screen time (or actually, there's not too many characters: there's just too many great actors playing those characters – but then again, that's half of the fun). Of all the X-men films, this has the most complex plot – and also the most interesting. Different time-lines are tricky to do and can be rather hard to follow, but thanks to a (very!) clever script with a great part for Logan, we never get lost. And that's the best news: sorely missed in the last instalment (except for a hilarious cameo), the franchise has Hugh Jackman back. And of him at least we do get to see a lot, since he really leads us through this film (giving his best Wolverine performance yet along the way). If Logan can be called the heart of the X-men, then Charles Xavier must be the mind while Magneto and Mystique provide the - slightly twisted - soul, and seeing them all together again brought a broad, stupid grin to my face (which only got broader whenever Quicksilver appeared on screen - for reasons you will have to find out for yourselves). What really sets the X-men films apart from the ever more derivative comic-book adaptations – at least as far as I'm concerned – is that I always genuinely cared for the characters, and 'Days of Future Past' is no exception. I love loud, spectacular action movies as much as the next guy, but if I don't get to care for the protagonists – what's the point? The reason I gave this 10 stars, and what is so exceptional these days, is that what we get here is a complex, smart Fantasy/Sci-Fi thrill-ride that respects its origins as much as it embraces the future, while never - ever - forgetting that its first job is to entertain the audience. For finding that perfect, rare balance between character-driven human drama and no-holds-barred popcorn action spectacle, 'Days of Future Past' deserves my 10-star rating (which is a first for me: I've never given 10-stars to a comic-book movie).So my verdict: If you like to get your minds blown by something with true heart and soul, this massive 'mutant' of a film is upon you, and all you have to do is give in to the X-citement. Enjoy the ride.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/\",\n",
       " '\"Airplane!\" is, was and always shall be the master of spoof movies. It is single-handedly responsible for literally inventing a sub-genre of comedy. It is the ultimate Silly Movie. A satire of the disaster movies of the 1970s, particularly the \"Airport\" series, nothing makes sense and it doesn\\'t need to. There\\'s no real plot. Just laughs - and plenty of \\'em.It was helmed by the ZAZ trio (Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker), whose dedication to making the audience laugh is surprisingly adamant. Recent spoofs may have left a bad aftertaste in your mouth, but it seems to be a universal agreement: \"Airplane\" is the funniest film of its genre ever made. (Closely followed by \"The Naked Gun\" - also penned by the ZAZ trio - perhaps.)The plot: Ted Striker (Robert Hays) is a war veteran-turned-cab-driver who decides to chase after his girlfriend, an airline stewardess named Elaine (Julie Hagerty), who has dumped him in order to pursue a new life. Right before her plane takes off, Ted climbs aboard, hitching a ride in order to woo her back into a relationship again.When the aircraft is in midflight, both pilots become very ill after eating their meals. Eventually many passengers begin to show symptoms of a rare disease, apparently transmitted by the food. Onboard, Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen) takes care of the sick passengers as Ted - an ex-fighter pilot from the war - decides to try and land the plane. If he messes up they will all die, and in a particularly funny scene, the pressure becomes so unbearable that he begins to literally sweat gallons in the cockpit.That is essentially all the film is about, but most of its duration is spent cracking jokes. Spoof films are entirely different from other movies because normally we would criticize a film if it considered its plot to be the least important element. Not so here. This is a truly brainless piece of celluloid - a movie that doesn\\'t try to be anything that it isn\\'t. From the opening credits - that cleverly spoof \"JAWS\" - to the closing we realize that this is an altogether unique film going experience.The movie\\'s biggest laughs come through unexpected flashbacks, such as when Ted remembers where he first met Elaine in a crummy bar (\"...it was worse than Detroit...\"), and begins to disco-dance a la John Travolta from \"Saturday Night Fever\" (complete with Bee Gees soundtrack blaring in the background and the famous Travolta pose). Then, later, we are taken back to when Ted was hospitalized after the war, and finds out that he was responsible for the death of six men. \"Seven, actually,\" he is informed, which adds to the pain of the moment for him. Though this movie is very funny, many jokes misfire. If you\\'re not pop culture savvy and you don\\'t remember Mrs. Cleaver from TV\\'s \"Leave it to Beaver\", the humor is going to go over your head. But unlike many comedies, \"Airplane!\" offers something unique for each person. I know that as a film lover, I picked up on many movie in-jokes that some people might not recognize. And then there were the gags that I first missed but picked up after a second viewing, or when someone explained them to me, or both. And I\\'m sure there are many yet that I\\'m not aware of. It seems that every time I watch it, there\\'s something else to laugh at that I missed previously.\"Airplane!\" not only was a huge success in 1980 (the year of its release), spinning off a horde of imitators and one sequel - it was also responsible for crowning Leslie Nielsen \"The King of Spoof.\" Prior to \"Airplane!\" Nielsen had been a veteran of more serious productions, stemming back to playing cowboys on \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" and other embarrassing attempts at acting. However, Nielsen later claimed that he had always wanted to do a comedy, even when he first started acting seriously with projects such as the classic \"Forbidden Planet\" (one of the best science-fiction films ever made). He later reunited with the ZAZ trio for \"The Naked Gun\" trilogy, appeared in similar spoof films over the years such as \"Wrongfully Accused\" and \"Scary Movie 3,\" and had his iconic comedy shtick ripped off by many screen veterans - most noticeably by George Gaynes in the unbearable \"Police Academy\" (1984).When it comes down to a single evaluation, \"Airplane\" is simply the best spoof film ever made. It\\'s like a MAD Magazine parody come to life. There are the occasional misfires, but unlike many other spoof film imitators, this one contains far more hits. The deadpan acting is genius and everything else fits into place, resulting in what may arguably be one of the absolute funniest films ever conceived and put on the big screen. And if you decide to watch the movie, don\\'t blink - you might miss a gag or two. The \"Police Academies\" will come and go but \"Airplane!\" will never be forgotten.',\n",
       " \"I honestly don't think I have ever seen a better movie than American History X in my entire life! I may only be 14, but I have seen a lot of movies. I am an avid fan of them, and this one just takes the cake. Edward Norton is just unbelievable. He is the most talented actor I've ever laid eyes on. His performance in the movie is phenomenal. He delves so deep into his character that he can convince the whole audience easily of his neo-nazi role. The look on his face as he walks back from killing one man in the first seen is purely horrifying. The entire move was dramatic, intriguing, and powerful. It really is moving and emotional as well as scary. It is so true to life, and provides the viewer with such insight into the life and events that create a monster such as Derek Vinyard. It answers many questions I have long awaited an answer to such as what could possibly make someone act as Derek did in this movie, yet left open-ended many others that people such as myself may have. Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely captivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than if Edward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts. It's bad enough he lost it to Cuba Gooding Jr. when he was in Primal Fear, which was yet another incredible performance by him. Edward Furlong, the little kid from T2 is astounding as the confused brother of Derek. I was stunned walking out of the theater after seeing American History X, and I don't think I will ever have the benefit of seeing another movie as good as this one as long as I live. I recommend anyone with a good tolerance for violent and graphic depictions go see this movie. I am bewildered as to why director Tony Kaye would ever want out of this success. If I were to rate this movie, as I often do for others in reviewing them for school, I would give it an A+ with all of my heart.\",\n",

'Nearing the end of life' moments and conversations are portrayed with an honesty and accuracy that make this film a true human drama.

       " 'Finally, a movie worth the full price of a ticket! Almost Famous is Cameron Crowe\\'s semi-autobigraphical story of an aspiring rock journalist who goes on tour with a band in the 1970\\'s. If it sounds familiar, it\\'s probably because the story is hardly new. There have been dozens of movies made about the rock and roll lifestyle: the drugs, the sex, the fights, and all the bumps on the road to success.So what sets Almost Famous apart? The acting, for one. Frances McDormand was brilliant as William\\'s (newcomer Patrick Fugit) well-meaning but overbearing mother. Fugit, for his part, had a convincing performance as the shy, awkward teenager struggling to be a journalist but at the same time aching to belong. Kate Hudson, in her breakout role as groupie \"Penny Lane\", gave her character depth beyond what might have been a limiting role. And Billy Crudup, as band Stillwater\\'s charismatic lead guitarist, shines. Jason Lee is always good, and as Stillwater\\'s lead singer, this role is no exception. And I can\\'t review this film without giving a shout-out to the chronically and criminally-underrated Philip Seymour Hoffman, who steals every scene he\\'s in with his portrayal of legendary rock journalist Lester Bangs.The writing in the film also contributes to its effect. Many of the great lines belong to McDormand but there are plenty of others to go around. In addition, the music of the era can\\'t be beat. Everything from Simon and Garfunkle to Alvin and the Chipmunks shows up at some point in the movie\\'s extensive musical score.The plot may not be particularly original, but it rings true. I of course am approaching this review as a music fan and someone interested in the industry. Nonetheless, I believe that even people who couldn\\'t care less about rock music will enjoy this movie, since it\\'s not so much about the music as it is about life. A central theme is the conflict of William: Should he remain a detached but lonely outsider so as to be an impartial journalist, or allow himself to make friends with these people and feel like he belongs? Aside from bringing up questions of journalistic ethics, this dilemma mirrors much of what people in all wakes of life deal with daily.Almost Famous is realistic, funny, touching, and one of those rare movies that makes you feel like you\\'ve gained something just for having seen it. It\\'s too bad that they say rock and roll is dead, cause we could sure use more movies like this one!',\n",

       " 'I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the \\'top five\\' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as \"one of Jack Nicholson\\'s finest roles\" and \"one of the classics of the 70\\'s\". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo\\'s Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy\\'s intention, as he believes the conditions in a \"crazy house\" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it\\'s desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in \\'Chinatown\\' or \\'As Good as it Gets\\'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can\\'t help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo\\'s Nest which hasn\\'t already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it\\'s glorious entirety. It\\'s hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.-10/10',\n",
       " '\"The Handmaiden\" is a crazily imaginative and beautiful movie by Chan-wook Park, who is at the top of his game in this story of a pickpocket that tries to steal the fortune of a naive, innocent rich woman that has been secluded in a mansion in the middle of nowhere. Of course, things will start to get complicated soon enough.Chan-wook Park has done a great job in adapting the original novel by Sarah Waters, and mixing it with the history of the Japanese invasion of Korea at the beginning of the twentieth century. The plot is a little bit silly sometimes, but Chan-wook Park makes it all tight and fast-paced, and even the most silly moment becomes a moment of beauty and fun. From the first moment, the viewer will be enthralled by the story of these two women and their relationship, and every plot development will just add fun to the whole.If the plot and the direction weren\\'t amazing enough, the movie is as beautiful as they come. From the darkest moment, the most violent, to the most intimate, beauty transpires in every frame, and every scene comes to life and threatens to pop and break free from the screen. This is helped by the amazing work of all the cast, who does an incredible job in bringing this tale to life (it could be criticized, though, some of the heavily accented Japanese, for characters that are supposed to be able to pass as them).All in all, \"The Handmaiden\" is proof that a movie can have a plot, amazing direction, acting, scenery, craziness and the most beautiful package possible. And even if it is almost two hours and a half long, it feels like a breeze.You will fall in love with this movie. Just plain great.',\n",

The obvious fun they are having, despite what I imagine to be uncomfortable filming locales, is palpable, and as an audience member, _if you allow yourself to be_, you WILL be swept up and transported by it.So, why ANY low ratings?While the first Jumanji was 'fun', underneath the fun, there were dark layers. There is none of that here and perhaps, this is where some of the disconnect from its detractors comes from. Unlike the original Jumanji, Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle is a fun, and funny, film throughout. In closing, quite to the contrary of what a couple of reviewers are saying about Robin Williams, such as: 'he'd be rolling over in his grave (over this movie)', Robin Williams was one of those rare and amazingly special individuals who found joy and humor in most everything, and who chose to share that with those of us who are lucky enough to be witness to some of the favorites he left behind. Personally, I find it in very bad taste and verging on offensive, that those who seem to not share the capacity to laugh or live the way he did, or the ability to laugh with the rest of us, and who lack the gift of both being able to give or receive the very humor which exuded from Mr. Williams, would dare say he would be doing anything other than laughing riotously while munching on some popcorn and watching this film.Thank you, Robin Williams, for the precursor which was so fantastic, it brought about an equally wonderful sequel.You are missed.\",\n",
       " \"Of all Arnold's mid-'80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be The Running Man. A chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality TV gone mad. It may have been far-fetched back then but not so now. Not when you think about it. Currently, Reality TV shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar. If the next one isn't more controversial as the last, it's a dud. How long will it be before we really do see shows like The Running Man? How long before we have 'court-appointed theatrical attorneys' or the entertainment division of the Justice Department? There is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of TV shows.The biggest message of all is 'You are being lied to'. It's no secret that the Government and the media work in cahoots. And the masses believe what the media tells them to believe. It's a very scary state of affairs and unless more accurate representations of the truth emerge we may easily accept a brutal show like the Running Man in the near future. It's no secret that Reality TV is not very realistic. It's edited and reshaped before being aired and it's only what the networks want you to see. Usually it's far from the real truth.Although rather different than Stephen King's book (the ending is completely changed) the script does conform to the typical Arnie formula. Yes, he does have numerous and very corny one-liners and he does say 'I'll be back' (which he never REALLY said that often anyway, when you think about it) in the most ironic situation yet but he's still a zillion times better in the role then Christopher Reeve or Dolph Lundgren would have been (these two were considered BEFORE Arnie believe it or not).The director is none other than Dave Starsky himself (Paul Michael Glaser). It may not be artistic but it is still strong enough to generate excitement and his use of neon and flourescent colors gives each individual set a pretty cool look. Andrew Davis (not a director I particularly like) was attached before Glaser, though no matter who directs, the film is still marred by a very heavy 80's feel.First of all, Harold Faltermeyer's score (remember him?) is incredibly dated and robs the action scenes of any timeless integrity. And the fashion sense of the movie is far too excessive to be convincingly set in the future. Apart from the dated feel, the only other thing that bugs me is the poorly staged shoot-out that passes as the climax.This new DVD is a zillion times better than the original release. Gone is the horrid letterbox picture. In its place is a brand new hi-definition 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer. The colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen. The new Dolby 5.1 EX and DTS ES soundtrack are also amazing. There constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful. Definitely one of the best re-masters I've seen so far. Two intriguing documentaries, a trailer and a 'Meet the Stalkers' gimmick are included in this 2-disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case.\",\n",
       " 'Firstly Ridley Scott\\'s talent as a director is undeniable. And it is for the most part well displayed in \"The Last Duel.\" Secondly I was pleasantly surprised at Matt Damon\\'s acting chops in the film. I consider Damon a yeoman talent. Certainly not top top tier actor, but a very good one, and he does very vey well in the film. I did not think Adam Driver, who has a stunning range in his career did well in this part. Jodie Comer, after you have seen her in a few roles seems to be repetitive and I was not impressed with her portrayal of her role in Duel.But my main impression is that aside from a number of really dramatic action sequences, the narrative inappropriately tries to impose modern mores. This just doesn\\'t work. It is a jarring anachronism given this is set in late medieval, pre-Enlightenment times. Similar to the problem in the narrative in \"Kingdom of Heaven\" were historians critiqued the narrative element of having the lead characters on both sides displaying modern and thus utterly artificial views of tolerance that were manifestly not present in anyone at the time the piece was set. With Dual and Kingdom one gets the feeling of a fourth wall-like didactic lecture to audience.Lastly to those who say noting the similarity with Rashomon is wrong, OI can only say you havent seen Rashomon. The Last Duel has been called \" \"Rashomon crossed with #MeToo\" and \"Ridly Scott\\'s Rashomon.\"I saw this Athens Film Festival while in Greece on business. 6/10.',\n",

Unfortunately this movie doesn\\'t treat it like that, rather in a sort of narcissistic propagandistic fashion that insults the intelligence of the viewer.The movie treats the entire problem nearly as a set of feelings. These sorts of things hurt people\\'s feelings and therefore they are bad. The whole thing was a very shallow production with very little depth into the subject matter.Since I forecast stuff for a living, my gut feeling is people who hate guns will like the propaganda, people who love guns will dislike it, and most people will just find the whole thing rather boring.And it\\'s a shame because the actors were pretty good and it was interesting after watching a decade of Dance Moms, seeing Maddie Ziegler in a sexy \"anti-type\" role. I thought she did quite well given the material. She does do a half a minute or so of dancing as a plot backdrop, but her character\\'s purpose in the movie is not as a dancer. So I hope this moves her acting career along.',\n",
       " 'I\\'m a big Star Wars fan (watched Empire Strikes Back in the cinema when I was 8 years old) and I loved this movie. With Empire Strikes Back and Rogue One, my favorite in the series.As for the movie itself, my opinion is that it\\'s a solid adventure movie, in the style of the great Indiana Jones movies, with lots of fun and intense action, witty dialogues, great humor and solid acting from all actors. Yes, Han must meet a certain Wookie, obtain a certain spaceship and meet a certain curly hair character to maintain coherence with past movies, but the \"necessary\" scenes, even if expected are still brilliantly developed. On top of these scenes, there are several surprising scenes that run the gamut of the best of what the Star Wars universe offers: chases, spacecraft battles, shootouts, aliens galore and lots lots of anti laws of physics split-second solutions.Still, my favorite take from this movie is that they finally managed to shoot an amazing movie that is far from the epic good-evil battles of previous Star Wars movies, and this is completely in tune with the Han Solo character (and, btw, I think Alden Ehrenreich is a perfect match for the role).In summary, if you think the movie is \"unnecessary\" and not needed, it will indeed disappoint you and I would advice you not to watch it, but if you go to watch it with a no-expectations open mind, I think you\\'ll be greatly pleased and much entertained.(and my excuses for any English mistakes; my mother tongue is Spanish)',\n",
       " \"We loved Green Book along with the sold-out crowd who applauded loudly at the end. Based on true story of piano virtuoso, Don Shirley's road trip through the south during the 60's, the film pays tribute to his genius and courage as a black man who tries hard to soar above the ugliness of the times. The elegant trappings of his home and his success as a concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold and lonely, but his life begins to change when he hires Tony as his road trip driver. With a history as nightclub bouncer with Mafia connections in New York, Tony is the antithesis of Don's perfection and their evolving relationship on the road makes the movie soar above the ordinary and become magical. Viggo and Ali in the main roles are remarkable, and it's funny and endearing to watch them discard stereotypes and discover their mutual humanity. What we liked best is the\\nmovie teaches without preaching, it all unfolds through a myriad of natural moments between two great actors and a strong supporting cast. Top all this off with a really good soundtrack, excellent direction and production values, and an audience that laughed out loud and vigorously applauded at the end...this one is a true 10!\",\n",
       " \"All the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls, idiots, or didn't are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies. Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding. It's like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot. It's utterly ridiculous!There have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point. All 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war. Infinity War IS the end game movie. There is nothing left to explain, nothing left to discuss, it is all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. There have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and/or the heroes that come together to fight Thanos in this movie. It's like a long game of chess where Thanos finally makes his move, and it's a huge one.So I beg of any of you who reads this. Don't listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot, has no reason and is only fighting. They aren't worth listening to, Infinity Wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death, and the movie is done to near perfection. The movie is glorious, the CGI is fantastic, the battles are awe-inspiring, and Thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning.

I had to put my popcorn on the ground because it felt inappropriate to eat popcorn while watching this movie. I even felt wrong laying down in my recliner chair, so I moved it in an upright position. This movie holds a great deal of gravity. It's heaviness is devastating, and if you let it, it could flip your world upside down. The whole point of the film is to flip your world, because unfortunately we merely go about life as if these atrocities aren't happening. This movie will try and wake you up to the sick reality of child trafficking. I reckon it will be successful. It's incredibly well done, has a fantastic compelling script, for having little budget on the actor scene, I'd say it's performances were beyond excellent.

I thought the title was weird, and readied my thumb on the remote channel selector...pointed it at the TV...and it stayed there for the rest of the movie! I couldn't stop watching! I've never seen a movie like this. The movie has a beautiful aspect (especially the end). And there are a few chuckles as well. Contrary to the more critical commentary, there is depth and complexity to the story that kind of requires you to see it more than once. I'm no genius, but what I gathered the basis of Donnie Darko to be is about our part in the deliberate DESIGN of our destiny, and I catch more each time I watch it. Regardless of anything, sincere thought and expression went in to the making of Donnie Darko. Mixed with skill and technical ability = Art.A WORK OF ART!  In the top 100 movies of all time in my opinion.\",\n",
       " 'Its Hitch\\'s most briskly entertaining movie, and one of his most comic, adventure-caper type movies, largely thanks to the persona of Cary Grant. But its also one of his most suspenseful - in the fact that Grant is being recognised as someone else, and that he may be put in jail for someone else\\'s crime.I\\'ve finally come to realise just how great North by Northwest is. The reason you should love Hitchcock is he put entertainment upfront.  Hitchcock was not interested in whether this or that would happen in real life: he was interested in what would make the most entertaining scene for the movie. North by Northwest is a peak in this regard. The dialogue and situations intentionally throw reality to the wind - the double-entendre dialogue in the love scenes is not supposed to be the way people talk!If you said to Hitchcock \"as if he\\'d keep driving\" or \"as if she\\'d do that\" - he would just laugh at you and say you\\'ve missed the point. This is 100% movieland, and once you get used to the fact, and that this is not a fault in the film, but done intentionally, you\\'ll love it. Its expressionistic - everything happens in movie language: the people laughing at Grant in the elevator, the way he keeps driving drunk near the beginning, the way he grabs the knife and everyone stares at him after someone\\'s been stabbed.It flirts with the idea of identity. I thought it was interesting how Grant first is dismissing, then incredulous that people should be calling him by another name; then, as the tries to find out who this guy is, he enters the hotel room of this new identity, then he puts the suit on, and finally he identifies himself as George Kaplan.A succession of fantastic, memorable scenes, a great leading man in Grant, and one of Hermann\\'s essential Hitch scores make for a movie i can put on at any time.10/10',\n",
       " \"When the 1997 version of Lolita was widely censored in the US, many asked why the reaction was so strong to this film.  After all, the novel was published in the US in 1958, Kubrick's film version appeared in 1962, and we hear more shocking tales of sexual depravity every day on the daytime talk shows.  But after seeing Lyne's brilliant version of Lolita, I can see how he manages to breathe fresh controversy into this familiar story.  Lyne's lascivious lens eroticizes Lolita's every movement and pose.  The viewer is forced to see her through the eyes of Humbert and to feel his obsession and desire.  We are co-conspirators in his crime, and at the end we share his shame.  Rather than shocking us (and having us pull away in revulsion), Lyne draws us in and makes us face the Humbert in ourselves.  This is an incredibly powerful film.\",\n",
       " \"I went along to the movies not really wanting to see this movie, thinking it was a 'girly' movie, one which had more technical skill rather than a storyline. I was surprised more than anything I could imagine. I have seen a lot of movies in my time, but this movie just took me by storm. Its uniqueness, ironically enough because it was based on a real life situation was a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood blockbuster. This movie provided a brilliant (pardon the pun) insight into many aspects of a genius at work. This movie touched me on many levels. The psychology of the movie was intriguing, the mathematical philosophies was actually realistic from my own experience, and the icing on the cake making the movie stand out was surprisingly the humanistic side of Love. While love is a common basis in most movies, the interaction of this theme with other aspects of the plot was planned phenomenlly. As for the cast, I have never noticed the actual difference in skill between many actors/actresses before. I like Mel Gibson, Tom Cruise etc, but I wouldn't be able to pinpoint a classic actor's performance. But Russell Crowe in this film showed me what it was like to act in a way where I was in awe of his skill in playing this character, especially when considering the extreme difference from characters in his other movies such as the Gladiator and The Insider. Russell Crowe was one of the big reasons this movie was so brilliant. Added to that the stellar performances of Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris and Adam Goldberg, and this made for the 'perfect' movie. A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original, intelligent and entertaining movie I have ever seen. And this from a movie I didn't expect big things from. Kudos to Ron Howard, the cast and the crew of this movie. It was truly worthy of the Oscar, and Russell Crowe was definately the most deserving of this production team to miss out on the highest accolade. Perhaps politics played a bigger part than I previously would have thought.\",\n",

       " 'I\\'m going to be honest about this: I like unabashedly violent action films. I\\'m 42 years old, I\\'m from Texas and I can take it. Growing up with films like \\'Rambo\\', \\'Die Hard\\', \\'The Terminator\\' and \\'Robocop\\', I can\\'t stand that watered-down \"no-blood-no-swearing\" gutless kiddie fare that is being served as \"action\" these days. I know the real thing when I see it - we used to see it all the time back in the day - and I hardly ever see it anymore.Which brings me to this movie. \\'Kingsman: The Secret Service\\' was being shown just around the corner from where I live, and because I loved two of director Matthew Vaughn\\'s previous films, \\'Layer Cake\\' and \\'Kick-Ass\\', I naturally took the chance to see it. I had already read some comments from previous screenings that this film was totally bad-ass, and I can now say that\\'s actually putting it mildly. This film is nothing short of bat-shît crazy.Years ago Tarantino said in an interview that he had written a James Bond script and that he would love to direct a Bond film. Sadly, that never happened, but ever since I read that I wondered what an R-rated Bond might be like. I don\\'t know, maybe Matthew Vaughn has read that interview too and saw the potential, because \\'Kingsman\\' is pretty much that: An ultra violent, funny, crazy, foul-mouthed James Bond film (with a little bit of \\'Men in Black\\' and \\'Mission Impossible\\' thrown in). You could say that this is to Bond what \\'Game of Thrones\\' is to \\'Lord of the Rings\\': Where the former can\\'t and dare not go (for marketing and box office reasons), the latter joyfully and gloriously ventures. Dirty and (very black) humor - check. Bad language - check. Gratuitous violence - check. Needless to say, I was thrilled.But it\\'s also a fantastic action film with an amazing cast (Oscar winners Colin Firth and Michael Caine, plus Sam Jackson AND Mark Hamill) and spectacular, over-the-top fight-scenes that in some instances even rival films like \\'The Raid\\' for their sheer visceral intensity. In short, if you\\'re as fed up with lame wannabe Die-Hards and Terminators as I am, go watch this film. Apart from the rare \\'John Wick\\' or \\'Equalizer\\', \\'Kingsman\\' seems to be pretty much the only antidote to the toothless, generic tripe Hollywood tries to pass for action these days. 9 stars for the film and the story, 11 stars for the balls to pull this off the way they did. Average = a perfect 10.EDIT:P.S. I recently stumbled upon an article on the importance of R rated movies.

       " \"When people watch the Oscars, they don't usually care about the Best Foreign Film nominees. Incendies provides so many reasons why people should actually get to see those nominees at all costs. Incendies is the kind of film that one walks away from feeling emotionally drained, one where it stays in the viewer's mind for days on end. Like an intense personal experience, it takes a lot to come to grips with the film's story, a moving plot full of twists and catharsis. At the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York, at which I saw this last night, Denis Villeneuve explained that he has made four films in Canada, but this is the first one to be released in America. Right now, I see no reason why Villeneuve, or any of the actors for that matter, shouldn't have a great future ahead of them.Based on the play Scorched by Wajdi Mouawad, Incendies follows a non-linear plot that spans two generations. In the present day, Jeanne and Simon are twins who have lost their mother, Nawal. Nawal has stipulated in her will that Jeanne and Simon must return an envelope to the brother they didn't know existed who is currently living in a fictional Middle Eastern country. Only then can the twins give Nawal a proper burial. Jeanne feels obligated to return the letter, so she goes to the Middle East, only to realize some of Nawal's nastiest secrets. As Jeanne uncovers more about Nawal, the viewer is shown Nawal's story. The film builds up to an unforgettable ending that is sure to rock any viewer.Incendies already had great source material. I've praised the plot enough, but one thing I must add is that the play is apparently four hours long, according to Villeneuve. It's impressive that this movie succeeds so nicely because I can't imagine that anything was cut. But to back up that source material, there's some really great acting. The entire cast plays their parts with such an emotional vigor that it seems impossible that this work of art wasn't autobiographical.Furthermore, Villeneuve has made a film that relies on great filmmaking to impact the viewer. The cinematography is beautifully bland, surely a nod to some of the deserts in the Lebanon- like land where the movie takes place. Color scheme is also used to Villeneuve's advantage to show the parallels between Nawal and Jeanne's lives. Villeneuve seems to love working with extended zoom shots that shock the viewer with their overwhelmingly long silences. Why Villeneuve didn't receive critical acclaim (in America, at least) before Incendies is a mystery.There are many movies about the Middle East. Some have failed miserably in their attempts to strike an emotional chord with critics and viewers alike (Redacted, Rendition), but others have been extremely successful (The Hurt Locker, Lebanon). Incendies could very well be one of the best films ever made about the conflicts in the Middle East. It has its flaws which keep it from being a masterpiece (maybe it could've lost five or ten minutes), but it is that rare type of film that really resonates beyond the initial viewing. Hopefully, Incendies will be remembered for years to come as the little, brilliant film that spawned the great fame of Denis Villeneuve.\",\n",

The kids scenes which should convey lightheartedness & adolescent romanticism are so retro novelle vagiue artificial that they are not only unbelieveable and boring but also embarassing for the poor taste of the director.

       " \"This impressively naturalistic and quietly devastating exploration of consent focuses on sixteen-year-old Tara as she takes a trip to Malia with her best friends, the envy-prone Skye and the empathetic Em, to celebrate the completion of her exams - and, perhaps, to distract her from the anxiety surrounding her soon-to-be-released grades - by drinking, clubbing and maybe, just maybe, hooking up with some strangers. The trip holds extra importance for her, as she's the last of her friends to still be a virgin and feels the need to rectify this before she returns back home (largely due to societal pressure pushed by her peers - or, rather, one in particular). Strikingly realistic in its every aspect, the picture plays out like an authentic coming-of-age slice of life and keenly cuts to the core of a feeling all too familiar with so many of us, particularly women. While it does generally have a fly-on-the-wall vibe, it also makes use of distinct cinematic techniques to draw you wholly into its hero's headspace. It's an intimate, often incredibly uncomfortable picture that has a lot to say and isn't afraid to say it. It doesn't so much start a conversation as it does make its point and let you chew on it; the ethics surrounding its central issues are pretty black and white, and they aren't intended to be debated so much as communicated. Indeed, 'How To Have Sex (2023)' actually has an implied 'Not' in the title. Whether it reflects someone's own experience and makes them feel seen or challenges someone's behaviour and (hopefully) makes them be better in the future, the film will likely resonate deeply with everyone in its audience. Its power grows the longer you have to sit with it, and its true brilliance is only really evident in retrospect. It's a powerful picture, for sure, arguably because of - not in spite of - its general subtlety. It's essential viewing for, well, pretty much everyone, really.\",\n",
       " \"I feel like I can't come up with the right words to describe this incredible movie, but I'll try. The lingering atmosphere is done incredibly well from the beginning, helped along by a combination of a tense score and the use of extended periods of silence. The acting is bang-on and you don't know when or how it is going to end. The movie doesn't have 'twists' exactly, but the way it is written keeps you guessing constantly. And I personally loved the ending. Though the potential is there to use a more standard approach, The Witch however opts to go down a more subtle avenue, leading to the true nature of religious persecution that is on full display here. Additionally, elements of the story have been taken from historical documents, adding another layer of grimness. The supernatural elements are obviously up for discussion, but that these tales were written centuries ago somehow adds more to this disturbing film.The film is set in 1630, in New England, America. A Puritan family is banished from town for their beliefs (or it at least seems this way, perhaps based on real events). They are forced to move to a farm that feels like it is on the edge of the world, as from the opening the woods that line the farm are presented in ominous fashion, almost creating a character that could serve as the scariest element of the film. What exactly goes on in there? Why can't the children venture inside? Suddenly, without warning, tragedy strikes. The family clings to their faith to prevent them from starving as their crops die; with nothing they can do to prevent it.The period is an appropriate choice given how humans treated each other centuries ago, and an ideal setting for a horror tale. Some conversations require a little more attention, as the characters speak in 'ye olde English' which takes a little getting used to, but it adds another layer of mystery as the family is struck by more inexplicable hardships, causing them to become wary of each other, which in turn leaves them in a increasingly vulnerable state. I can't say I is scared, but I do know that I is gripping the armrests pretty hard for most of the film. Hell, they manage to make a scene where a man is hunting a rabbit seem tense and creepy! Additionally, this is not for inattentive viewers; I could see clock-watching all around me. The incredible camera-work almost reminds me of Paul Thomas Anderson in There Will Be Blood, with many long takes, often slowly panning or zooming in. There is also a focus on facial close-ups reminiscent of Bergman, all of which is a feast to watch on an IMAX screen. The score matches this camera-work almost to perfection, while there is often a lengthy silence between dialogue to contrast the tense music. It also must be mentioned that the child actors really shine, out-doing their older counterparts.This really is my sort of horror film. No jump-scares, convincing acting and a focus on a dark, foreboding atmosphere rather than the grotesque and bloody. This is another of those films I would label as a psychological thriller, as the supernatural horrors are kept almost completely out of view as we witness the downfall of a family who are all affected, turning on each other as their faith is truly tested.This film couldn't have catered to my interests more; I can't recommend it to everybody, but if you go in with no preconceived notions you'll be in for a tasty, if not nasty surprise.

       " \"I am not normally one to write reviews, but I couldn't help reading several for this film on this site that just did't seem to understand where I think the film was supposed to be coming from.The majority of the complaints I saw were that the film was 'too depressing for a children's film', but whilst I see where they are coming from in some regards, every child who I have seen watch this film (I work in a cinema) has absolutely loved it, and laughed out loud almost constantly. They are not old enough to realise the message the film is trying to convey: that life isn't all about happiness. I applaud the attempt from Pixar to make a film that is not only hilarious in places, but is also a major comment on what life is like to be a younger teenager, transitioning through one of the most important moments of life. From a more personal perspective, why should everything we show our children gloss over the reality of life, and try to make them believe everything is rosy 24/7? Again, what this film does brilliantly through the message I took away at the end was that life will never be 100% full of happiness, but that is fine. Why does it have to be? A little bit of sadness is necessary. If a person was never sad, they would be inhumane. Overall then, I suppose my review is more of a comment on the type of film we exhibit to children, and how the Nanny-state we live in looks to protect them from most of lives inevitabilities. Either way, what can't be ignored is that this film is equal parts sad, and equal parts what I am sure will become a timeless classic in years to come.\",\n",
       " \"A sprawling Western epic that follows the adventures of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen gold, Sergio Leone's `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is a masterpiece, one that continues to get better and better with each viewing.  In a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in a realistic manner.  Sometimes, crime does pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good does go unrewarded. This film probably signaled the death knell of the traditional John Wayne `White Hat/Black Hat' Western.The three main characters make the film.  Lee Van Cleef (`The Bad') is evil personified.  Totally ruthless, he'll do whatever it takes to get what he wants.  Clint Eastwood (`The Good') is the Man With No Name, not really `good' in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing.  (Watch the scene when he gives a dying Confederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful, and it sums up everything that the Man With No Name is all about, without saying a single word.)  Eli Wallach (`The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most complex - if not the best - character in the film.  All impulse and rage, Tuco spins wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be Clint Eastwood's best friend in one scene, trying to kill him in another - Tuco truly represents `the ugly' side of people.The movie is long, but there's not a wasted scene in the film.  Each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more about each character and what's going on.  The pacing is incredible, as is the direction - Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film, keeping the film from ever getting predictable.  Any typical Western cliché that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling.  Of special mention is Ennio Morricone's score, which is absolutely perfect.  Two scenes - one in a Union prison camp, one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film - are amazing on their own, but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with Morricone's powerful score. This movie is absolutely brilliant.  If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly urge to do so.  Immediately.  (And then, go watch `Unforgiven' . . . in a way, I think that `Unforgiven' is the sequel to `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly - it's the story of what eventually happened to the Man With No Name.) `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is easily one of the best Westerns ever made.

It is basically a combination of heist movie and revenge thriller. But it's played very straight, without a lot of effort to build characters, and doesn't ever seem to build much momentum. So a few times during the movie I found myself looking at my watch, wondering if it was really going anywhere.The action is fairly tight but mainly gunplay, not much physical action as Statham is famous for.There are no heroes either, Stathams character seems to be a pretty nasty piece of work himself.All in all, it's an average thriller with nothing in particular to recommend it.\",\n",

       " \"This movie ticked all the boxes for me. A genuinely funny whodunnit with some great suspense scenes and likeable characters everywhere you look. That's basically the summation of my ideal film. This one was a blast.The time travel between 2023 and 1987 opens up some great opportunities for comedy, pointing out the differences between the two time periods. The film does a great job of taking advantage of these without over-doing it.It's a film that finds a really good balance in almost all areas. For example, when you are balancing comedy and horror it can be easy to lean too far in one direction and take away from the other when those scenes come up. That isn't the case here. When the film is funny, it is funny. When it is trying to be suspenseful, it is suspenseful. One genre never feels like it gets in the way of the other.The best thing this film has going for it though are the characters. Every single character in this movie is perfectly crafted. The ones who are meant to be likeable are extremely likeable. The ones who are meant to be despicable are truly despicable. There are no throwaway characters. Even the adults are well crafted and fleshed out.'Totally Killer' was a great film to see in the cinema at Fantastic Fest on closing night. The audience all seemed to love it and I was right there with them having a great time myself. 9/10.\",\n",
       " 'Sometimes reading the user comments on IMDB fills me with despair for the species.  For anybody to dismiss 2001: A Space Odyssey as \"boring\" they must have no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making.  Finally I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous - they understand their audience.Thankfully, those that cannot appreciate Kubrick\\'s accomplishment are still a minority.  Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic.  This is the film that put the science in \"science fiction\", and its depiction of space travel and mankind\\'s future remains unsurpassed to this day.  It was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasn\\'t caught up.2001 is primarily a technical film.  The reason it is slow, and filled with minutae is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes).  The film\\'s greatest strength is in the details.  Remember that when this film was made, man still hadn\\'t made it out to the moon... but there it is in 2001, and that\\'s just the start of the journey.  To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief - I still can\\'t work out how some of the shots were done.  The film\\'s only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankind\\'s technological (and social) development.  It is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001, not Kubrick\\'s.Besides the incredible special effects, camera work and set design, Kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human, and where the human race is going.  Yes, the ending is weird and hard to comprehend - but that\\'s the nature of the future.  Kubrick and Clarke have started the task of envisioning it, now it\\'s up to the audience to continue.  There\\'s no neat resolution, no definitive full stop, because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel.  I know that\\'s what most audiences seem to want these days, but Kubrick isn\\'t going to let us off so lightly.I\\'m glad to see that this film is in the IMDB top 100 films, and only wish that it were even higher.  Stanley Kubrick is one of the very finest film-makers the world has known, and 2001 his finest accomplishment. 10/10.',\n",

It was really last minute and I didn't know much about it other than it was from the makers of The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up and it looked pretty funny.I expected it to be funny, but my expectations were blown out of the water. It was extremely smart and pretty much believable. Well, some of the situations are a little ridiculous, but what's a good comedy without a little nonsense? But the characters were all so awesome.There were a few parts where i was a little uncomfortable.

One being that I was a little unimpressed with the trailer, but trust me, after you see this movie you will realize that most of the movie couldn't have possibly made it into the trailer. Another reason was the writers.... their previous works being The Ghosts of Girlfriend's Pasts and Four Christmases and Rebound. I don't know what they did between those and this but damn did they step their game up.Now, the movie is hilarious. I have become so used to the thought of the Judd Apatow gang being the only ones to make truly funny films, but I realized very quickly into this movie that I was dead wrong. I think this movie was by far ten times funnier than Pineapple Express, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Step Brothers, etc. And I find each of those flicks truly, hilariously, funny.I remember watching Superbad the first time and thinking that that was the funniest movie ever made, when it comes to films with legitimate plots and characters, etc. And maybe Superbad and The Hangover are pretty close, but who knows....So PLEASE see this film. The audience I saw it with was laughing hysterically every five minutes at least. There is enough one-liners to quote all summer, and enough subtle jokes to laugh about later on that you didn't catch the first time.OH and by the way, if you love Old School, you will LOVE the ending.

With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!The whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film. The cast of the film was pretty much perfect, they should all be applauded too. Emma Watson, as usual is and great and she'll have a bright career ahead of her. Rupert Grint is pretty much great also, he is a fine actor indeed. Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job and was very memorable as Harry Potter. Although I think Ralph Fiennes was the star of the film, he did unbelievable job as the evil, crazy Lord Voldemort, I think he deserves an Oscar Nomination for his role. The rest of the cast were also great too.We all grew up overtime with the series, we followed the adventures of Harry Potter for around 10 years, I think. It seems very weird that there will be no more Harry Potter films to look forward too. I will miss the franchise very much! However I am happy the series got an amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is not only the best film in the series, but it will probably be one of the best films of 2011. Everyone should see this film, even if they don't like past Harry Potter films.\",\n",
       " \"On paper it's a very classic script: rookie emergency service worker is paired with older and more experienced colleague and, well, things happen. But many films are classic on paper, yet not on the screen.This is a film with powerful scenes which stay with you for days after watching it.And it has its flaws: it lacks finesse at time, editing is sometimes inconsistent and the narrative may seem not original enough.But it makes up for all of that through the passion of showing the viewer a powerful message. Black Flies is a movie you will remember, and this is what all good films have in common. Years after seeing it you may still think about scenes you've seen and the characters' lifes and what happened to them. And isn't that what cinema is about, beyond perfect mise-en-scene and guidebook takes?I particularly appreciated the way it was filmed, especially during very graphic scenes, where the disturbing side was accentuated by the quickly moving and sometimes shaking camera.I also liked that, despite the fact the movie is supposedly much anchored to reality given its subject, it is filmed in a way that makes it feel like the characters are in another world, parallel and similar to ours, but with slightly different codes. Black Flies is almost like a video game world where violence is programmed and reason nonexistent, New York City is dark, gloomy and burning. In this inferno, the characters live an infinite struggle to save sometimes unsaveable people, making their role look like a necessary curse, a drop of good in an ocean of evil.8/10.\",\n",
       " 'Remember how everyone was talking about Toy Story when it first came out? The incredible visuals, unique style, vividly imagined world? The next time people were talking that way with such enthusiasm about a computer animated movie was Finding Nemo. I\\'m excited to say that Ratatouille will be the next one to redefine the visual creativity and technical detail of computer animated movies. Honest to goodness, I was awestruck by the animation, and that never happens to me. It is a visual masterpiece of a movie if ever the term applies.The next thing to talk about is the \"genre\" of the movie. As Pixar enthusiasts will tell you, Brad Bird, the director of Ratatouille, also directed The Incredibles, which has the most inspired and creative action sequences from any of the Pixar movies. Ratatouille, while not so straightforward with its action, has almost as much as The Incredibles did, in unique ways. Most memorable is the shotgun scene near the beginning. (You\\'ll know what I\\'m talking about when you see it). Other than that, this is the expected comedy-with-heart movie from Pixar that so many have grown to love.The voice acting? Spot on. Every voice is distinctive, and it never feels like a celebrity\\'s voice tacked on to a character (Shrek, I\\'m looking at you), it feels like the characters themselves speaking. You can\\'t ask for more from voice acting.And finally, the script and the story. The entire irony of the story -- a street rat with a passion for fine food -- is beautiful, and a tight, smart, wonderful script flows from this. The pacing of the story is odd and choppy at places, but this is a very forgivable grievance. The only other minor fault is that a few of the dramatic one-liners feel a bit forced. Other than that, this is the most layered, complex, and satisfying script from Pixar since The Incredibles.Overall, I recommend that everyone see this movie when it hits theaters (I was lucky enough to see a pre-release screening). Though not perfect, it is an animated masterpiece in true Pixar form with breathtaking animation and visual design.10/10',\n",

It really fell flat for me and the script/dialog was sometimes awkward and/or did not make sense. I'm surprised IMDb only listed one 'goof'.

No question, the visuals were great, the acting was great, but the editing, PLOT and over-all effect was simply unsatisfying.The plot is full of discontinuity and random plot elements, and the main time reversal issue is never adequately explained, resolved or identified, and even the cryptic \"Tenet\" keyword never seems to appear outside of the trailer cuts. The most annoying aspect was the often incomprehensible audio, due to masks and bad editing, that made many key moments a total mystery.The plot is also littered with bad science of every possible kind, random statements that simply make no real sense (even using the odd time scenario) , and when viewed as ongoing story make you stop and say, how did we ever get HERE? The gun and bullet demonstration really sticks in my mind as total and complete cinematic plot garbage.I don\\'t doubt this could have been a masterful movie, but unlike Memento or Inception, the script and story continuity were simply not up to the complex story task.

A stork in the woods as it rains. A cluster of dolls piled up on the floor with flies buzzing all over the room. You don\\'t need vast, elaborately choreographed battle scenes to bring home the message of the senselessness and pain of war. Reading viewers\\' comments on the movie, it seems that most found the second half \\x96 which admittedly contained some of the most powerful massacre scenes ever filmed \\x96 as the most \"satisfying\". A few other viewers seem to imply the movie doesn\\'t really get going until the second half. For me, it was the first half that got under my skin the most, for its cinematic originality, poetry and symbolic power. War is experienced by civilians as well as by soldiers: this may seem like an obvious statement, but it\\'s only after watching Come and See that you realise how few war movies are truly about the suffering of the ordinary man and woman, defenseless child and frail senior citizen. Also, never before had I seen the plight of raped women in war so powerfully conveyed, and all this without the movie ever being voyeuristic or graphic. In cinema, rape is often portrayed as something that looks like rough sex. It isn\\'t always quite clear why women get so upset over it. In Come and See, rape is shown as nothing but pure, unadulterated, hate-fuelled violence with only a superficial, external resemblance to sex. Unlike other raped women on film, you cannot imagine those in Come and See ever healing from their scars. On another subject, whoever thinks this movie contains \"propaganda\" is obviously prejudiced against the movie simply because it\\'s a Soviet production, and should think things over a little more carefully. It\\'s astonishing how you can still find little traces of the Cold War mentality surviving to this day, even in younger viewers... The fact that as detractors of Come and See claim, Stalin \"was no better than Hitler\" has nothing to do with anything at all, in this movie\\'s context - Klimov\\'s picture is NOT about nationalistic oneupmanship on who had the worst tyrant - it\\'s about the basic suffering of ordinary humanity in war - ANY war, though this one happened to be going on in Bielorussia. There was in fact ten times more propaganda in ten minutes of Saving Private Ryan than the whole of Come and See. This is painful, sublime cinema.

But I\\'m one of the rare girls that loves baseball with a passion, I was raised in a very baseball oriented family, we live in Chicago, we kinda have to enjoy sports, lol. But growing up you wonder why baseball, football, basketball are more for the boys vs. the girls, girls can play but are not famous for it and if they are an athlete are accused of being manly. It\\'s a tough world, but when I was 7 years old A League of their Own was released in theaters, my family saw this movie together and my life changed. Sounds silly, but this was the movie that reminded me to stay strong, at the time when women were expected to stay in the kitchen, as hard as they had to work for it, there was a women\\'s baseball league during WWII. A League of their Own explores this hard but extremely fun time for the girls of the All American Baseball League.When World War II threatens to shut down Major League Baseball, candy manufacturing magnate Walter Harvey decides to create a women\\'s league to make money. Ira Lowenstein is put in charge of public relations and scout Ernie Capadino is sent out to recruit players. Capadino likes what he sees in catcher Dottie Hinson. She\\'s a terrific hitter and he offers her a tryout, but the married woman is content where she is, working in a dairy and on the family farm in Oregon while her husband is away at war. He\\'s less impressed with her younger sister, pitcher Kit Keller, who loves the game passionately but appears to be less talented. He finally lets her come along when she persuades Dottie to give it a try for her sake. When the trio arrive at the tryouts in Chicago, they meet Doris and Mae. They make it onto the team, The Peaches who are managed by drunkard former baseball great Jimmy Dugan. Jimmy initially treats the whole thing as a joke, leaving the managerial duties to Dottie. However, he takes over when he sees how hard and well his team plays. The league attracts little interest at first. With a Life magazine photographer in attendance, he asks them to do something spectacular. When a ball is popped up behind home plate, she catches it while doing splits; the resulting photograph makes the cover of the magazine. More and more people show up and the league becomes a huge success.The acting is absolutely superb, we have actors on top of their game, Tom Hanks who delivers the memorable \"There\\'s no crying in baseball!\" speech. Geena Davis who was a great heroine as the star of the league who just wants her husband home from the war but is hanging onto the league for her little sister\\'s sake. Even Madonna and Rosie O\\'Donnell are great together and have awesome chemistry as best friends Mae and Doris. This is one of those chick flicks that everyone has to see because it worked on every level. Penny Marshall truly brought out the pain these girls had to go through to be taken seriously. The ending always gets me in tears I have to admit, just knowing that these girls hung in there and stayed strong when everyone told them that girls couldn\\'t play ball, let\\'s hope that one day they\\'ll have the opportunity again.10/10',\n",

Yes eightiesness is a quality. It's a corny, dated quality but one that is tangible and valued by my fellow eighties loving brethren to this day. Come back with me if you will to a time when Anthony Michael Hall was still fielding calls and Kelly LeBrock was French for sexy.Weird Science has everything that an eighties comedy needs: A least one hot girl, a few actors who are no longer working or who do anything that will come along, plenty of dashing eighties threads, a corny as hell eighties soundtrack,(and Oingo Boingo is as corny and eighties as they get), and plenty of cheap funny jokes. Undoubtedly the best thing about Weird Science is Bill Paxton, who plays Wyatt's older brother Chet. Chet is the worst big brother ever to grace a movie screen and is a role model for all big brothers everywhere, me included. Chet delights in extorting money and valuables from Wyatt in exchange for his silence about Wyatt's activities. The best part in the movie is when Chet gets turned into the toad thing or whatever it is. Man I love that part. The rest of the cast does a good job of being their stock characters. Kelly LeBrock does a good job of being hot. Robert Downey Jr. shows none of the signs of future drug addiction. The film is unremarkable in the fact that it isn't anything groundbreaking or special. It's just a funny movie. And an eighties classic. Bottom Line: If you grew up in the eighties and you never saw Weird Science then you must atone for your crimes by going out and buying it right now. Then send me an email telling me how grateful you are that I put you on the path to rightousness and eighties correctness.\",\n",

I could so completely identify with both characters.  Bob is a middle-aged actor caught in a life which has lost its zest and purpose, doing what he \"ought\" to be doing (making money doing whiskey commercials) instead of doing what he WANTS to do (plays).  And then a young, beautiful, intelligent woman enters his orbit.  On that level alone, with its mute longing and sexual tension, I can identify with him.And then there is Charlotte, a student of philosophy seeking herself, her soul lost and adrift.  She doesn\\'t know who she is, doesn\\'t know what she wants.  Her life is a quest for authenticity of self.  And I identify with her because so much of my life I have been seeking the same thing.This movie isn\\'t for everyone.  They will call it boring, lifeless, limp. There are people, I realize, who have never experienced that kind of longing, who had never sought meaning in their lives, and searched for their own lost souls.  They live for the here and now, without giving a thought to the spiritual aspects of life.  A friend said introverts will love this movie, extraverts will hate it.  I think that is a fair surface assessment.  This movie is all about the inner lives of two people whose souls connect for a brief time in an alien city. It is a love affair not of bodies, but of minds and spirits.Some this movie will make angry.  Some this movie will make weep.',\n",

I also felt like Halle did a little better in this installment, considering better powers and better writing. The action scenes were great, especially in Jean\\'s house.

The only option left is to go on the run with his entire family. Despite its straightforward plot with minimal twists and humor, the film has managed to earn a commendable 7.2 rating on IMDb, based on 71 audience reviews.Taking a closer look, the movie appears to draw inspiration from \"True Lies,\" a factor that might resonate with fans of Schwarzenegger\\'s earlier works. However, beyond this familiarity, the film boasts commendable action sequences, and its overall narrative pace is expertly handled, preventing it from succumbing to dullness.The increasing inclusion of new Asian faces in Hollywood productions is a noteworthy trend. These aren\\'t the stereotypical portrayals but refreshing talents like Li Meiqi and Daniel Wu. With the burgeoning influence of the film and entertainment culture from emerging Asian nations, particularly South Korea, Hollywood must address and dismantle its antiquated stereotypes, especially those depicting Asians with big faces and squinty eyes.In a nutshell, \"Family Plan\" stands as a worthwhile addition to the action movie genre. However, it\\'s worth noting that the film crew might have exercised a bit too much frugality in their use of ketchup, metaphorically speaking. This nuanced observation adds an element of critique without overshadowing the overall positive appraisal of the movie.',\n",
       " 'Before all the slapstick, before re-writing \"Home Alone\" umpteen times and before selling his soul to \"Disney Pictures Inc.\", John Hughes was believed to be THE scribe for teen angst. He wrote eloquently of it in \"Sixteen Candles\", \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"Pretty in Pink\". And with \"Ferris Bueller\\'s Day Off\", he creates a person and a time in life that just about anyone who\\'s ever been a teenager can relate to.Who hasn\\'t known someone like Ferris Bueller (Broderick)? Someone who always has a plan, someone who made loafing off an art form, someone who could fall in a barrel of you-know-what and come out smelling like a rose?All he wants to do is take a day off from school and enjoy the day in Chicago - simple enough, but he must also try and convince his best friend Cameron (Ruck) and his best girl (Sara) to join him and, in the process, learn to enjoy what life has to offer.Naturally, there is a tyrannical school dean (Jones) who is determined to catch Ferris in the act of hookey and Ferris\\' own sister (Grey, pre-nose job) who has it in for her brother, the \"trouser-snake\". There are funny situations throughout the movie, and the characters are ones that grow on you, especially Ruck\\'s worry-wart portrayal of Cameron Frye, constantly fretting about his dystalic, cursing his father and nearly drowning in a pool, all in the name of friendship.Sara has less to do, but she plays the object of desire well, and Ferris\\' passion for her is understandable. At least he thinks about the right things, like what their lives would be like after high school.All the way from beginning to end, this movie is a great trip in search of fun, relaxation, not taking life too seriously and how to sing Wayne Newton songs in the middle of a parade. You want to catch vintage John Hughes and classic \\'80s teendom at its best? Seize this \"Day\"!Ten stars for \"Ferris Bueller\\'s Day Off\".',\n",
       " \"Among the thousands of films I have viewed, this movie would rank near the top for sheer entertainment. That's not saying it's the best-made or most intelligent or scariest or funniest or features the best effects, etc. etc. But combine all those and you have a film that's tough to beat when you're looking for 100 minutes of escapist fun.The film features some wild computer-enhanced special effects that were new to its day, but now about 10 years later, it's no big deal. In fact, some of it, such as the lion, look pretty hokey compared to the stuff that's out there now. To me, it was story that was the lure, anyway, not the special effects.Because it's so much fun, this is one of the fastest-moving films I've ever viewed. The time flies by. It's not to be analyzed or given much thought, because it's so ludicrous. You just go along for the wild ride in this fantasy-adventure and get a bunch of laughs and thrills along the way. That's one of the big attractions of this of film: the excellent combination of adventure and comedy.Are there annoying things in this movie? Sure. To me, it was Bonnie Hunt's occult beliefs and too many OMGs and the overdone character of the hunter (Jonathan Hyde). Other than that, I loved the film the first I saw it and every time afterward. I've probably viewed this movie as much as any, simply because it was so entertaining.Robin Williams, David Alan Grier and the two kids, Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce, were all great people to watch and share this adventure with.

       " 'Greetings again from the darkness. There aren\\'t too many companies who have reached the pinnacle of their industry, only to later flop due to lack of innovation or a stubborn insistence on holding on to the past. Tremendous success and absolute failure are not typically associated with the same company. Blockbuster Video and Pan Am Airlines come to mind as examples of industry leaders whose refusal to adapt, culminated with closure, and it\\'s likely that Blackberry belongs in the category, at least as presented here by writer-director Matt Johnson and co-writer Matthew Miller, adapting the book by Jacquie McNish.Socially awkward pals, Mike Lazaridis (played by Jay Baruchel) and Doug Fregin (played by the film\\'s director Matt Johnson), co-founded Research in Motion (RIM). The film picks up in 1996 when Mike and Doug are making their first presentation of their breakthrough handheld data delivery-email machine, which they have named Pocket Link. These are two genius nerds with no concept of how the outside business worlds functions, and the executive to whom they are pitching is so distracted that his only feedback is, \"You need a new name.\" In a fascinating twist, that same executive, Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton, \"It\\'s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\") ends up saving not just the new product, but also the company.Balsillie presents himself as a fireball, take charge, full-steam-ahead kind of guy. It\\'s quite a contrast to nerdy Mike and easy-going Doug. Mike is a quiet guy committed to perfection in his work, while Doug wrangles the tech developers with a culture of video games, movie night, and an overall fraternity environment. Balsillie\\'s arrival as a vocal outrage expert and brash businessman changes everything, and he and Mike drive the newly named BlackBerry to levels not previously seen. We do get a humorous anecdote from a shirt stain (even though it\\'s not a true story), and in fact, there is quite a bit of humor throughout.We are informed that the film was \"inspired by real people and real events\", so some dramatic license is expected. Perhaps the best comparison is THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010), and while that film was more polished, I personally found this one more entertaining and accurate from a business sense. An excellent supporting cast includes Cary Elwes, Saul Rubinek, Michael Ironside, Martin Donovan, Rich Sommer, and SungWon Cho, and the film\\'s real draw is the contrast between Jay Baruchel\\'s mousy but brilliant Mike, and Glenn Howard\\'s powerhouse portrayal of the egotistical Balsillie. Baruchel\\'s scene where he reacts to the new iPhone is alone worth the price of admission.At its peak, BlackBerry had 45% market share and had earned it\\'s \"CrackBerry\" label in the business world. Apple\\'s 2007 introduction of the iPhone not only rocked the BlackBerry company, it shook up the world. The Canada perspective is noted (RIM was based in Waterloo, Ontario), as is Mike\\'s aversion to \\'made in China\\', perhaps the ultimate reason for the fall. It\\'s likely that BlackBerry has become a Case Study in Business Schools, although the fast-paced and pressure-packed world of tech continues to require a balance of decisions focused on current markets and never-ending innovation for the future.Opens on May 12, 2023.',\n",

       " 'Just to clarify one thing: I don\\'t hate Tim Burton at all. In fact, I kinda love his work. He has a very unique and imaginative vision, seems to have a tasteful choice for actors (besides Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter), and can really pour his heart and soul in some of his films like \"Edward Scissorhands\", \"Corpse Bride\", and \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\". But, just like any director, he has his missteps also. Some of his recent work is very lackluster and, at times, flat-out bad (Planet of the... BLAHK!).But I was still excited for this particular project of his. I haven\\'t read the book, or knew much about it, but when I saw the trailer I got my hopes up. Maybe this will be his big comeback! Asa Butterfield is an actor I like, the imagery is appropriately dream- like and the source material seems to fit his style perfectly. It even has the screenwriter from X-Men: First Class!So I went to see the film with a few of my friends in a theater of around 15 people and 25-30 recliner seats. I couldn\\'t wait to see another great Tim Burton movie!And for the first half of the film... I genuinely enjoyed it! Sure, it does take some time for Jacob to reach Peregrine\\'s home, but once he does... I couldn\\'t help but smile like an idiot. The world that Jacob enters is fascinating, the visuals are exceptional, and every one of the peculiar kids are very interesting side- characters. I wanted to learn more about the girl that could lift boulders over her head! There is also this kid that can project his dreams into film... how cool! The first act always left me with questions that I was excited to hear about when the plot kicks in.And then the plot kicks in...That is where the movie starts to run out of steam.I could tell there were a lot of story elements in the book just from watching the movie, because in the second half a lot of it felt crammed in. Whenever I try to follow the story as best as I can, there\\'s always this one subplot that makes precious little sense. It also doesn\\'t help that the villain is weak and his motivations are somewhat vague.The climax is pretty abrupt and Burton sadly delves into a few clichés that aggravate me. A lot of it felt by-the-numbers at that time, and I was sorely disappointed.That\\'s not to say that this was a bad film, because it isn\\'t. The acting (especially from Eva Green) is competent, the whole film is imaginative in its story and visuals, and somewhere buried beneath lies a great film with lots of creative ideas and appealing whimsy. But the plot is messy, the main character is bland, the pacing is at times uneven and, in the end, it\\'s just another average YA adaptation that had loads of potential.VERDICT:+ Visuals + Well-cast, especially for Eva Green + Imaginative + Sense of wonder in the first act + Solid directing + Interesting side charactersVillain - The hero is underdeveloped - Plot is messy - Pacing is uneven - Unconvincing love chemistrySCORE: 5.5/10',\n",
       " \"Emma is one of my favorite Jane Austin novels. This production is a travesty overall. The costumes and hair and locations are sumptuous and beautiful but do little to cover the fact that the director and perhaps lead actress did not understand the book at all.Emma is meant to be charming and sweet if wrong headed and a bit spoiled. Her heart is good and she's usually incredibly kind except when under the influence of Frank Churchill and she immediately regrets her actions.In this version, Emma is rendered to be a superscillious brat with no real thought for anyone but herself. Bill Nighy is seriously underused and is one of the bright spots in the film. Miranda Hart is the only other bright spot. I'm not sure what on earth they were thinking. 2 hours of film went by without hitting in any part of the story that would lead to coherence. There was zero chemistry between any of the characters. They took a story that's light and charming and made it heavy and distasteful.I'd definitely not recommend this to either readers of the book or anyone else because they definitely will not have even a fraction of an understanding of the tone of the book and wonder why on earth anyone could care about this story at all.How very sad that they could have done a modern remake like this and just completely miss the mark.\",\n",
       " \"Just got home from an early British screening of this, my friend suggested we go and see it, I wish I hadn't, good money down the drain. Just like Jason Vorhees did some thirty odd years earlier Ghostface goes to New York for a new killing spree. It is set a few days before Halloween but sadly not a pumpkin or any other festive decoration in sight. A train ride, in which many people are dressed up in fancy dress (including several Ghostfaces) provides the only Halloween element, it is also one of the better scenes. Several of the cast from Scream 5 are back, including Courteny Cox (she may have well not bothered) but Neve Campbell wisely stayed away. I enjoyed part 5 but found the characters in 6 either uninteresting or annoying, there is also some bad acting (Dermot Mulroney in particular). Things do start quite promising with two good separate kills before the opening credits but sadly most of the fight/kill scenes that follow are just laughable, same thing can be said for the plot, ambitious but equally ridiculous. At 123 minutes this was too long for what is a poor slasher flick. This is a very flawed movie and in my opinion the worst to date but I don't think it will be the last.\",\n",
       " 'I haven\\'t seen a romance this touching since I was the same type of single sad sack as depicted by the hero of (500) Days of Summer. Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has his radar up for \"the girl of his dreams\" when he meets Summer (Zooey Deschanel). Too bad for Tom Summer is stuck on friends-with-benefits mode. Let the tension begin.Director Marc Webb captures the feeling of innocent, naïve love expertly. Anyone who has taken the lyrics of the Smiths too closely to heart, would be moved by the idea of the person they are crushing on sing to them: \"To die by your side/is such a heavenly way to die.\" No wonder Tom soon falls head over heels for this girl.As events unfold out of sequence, you know all along Tom has fallen for a time bomb of a woman, and he can\\'t even see the countdown. When that bomb finally blows up in his face, it unfolds with powerful simplicity-- no exposition or dialog, just two juxtaposed events that capture the heartache of reality hitting a person who sees a person through the filter of deep-seated emotions that were planted at too young an age.So many romantic films nowadays concern themselves with cute ideas; take \\'He\\'s Just Not That Into You\\' or \\'Serendipity\\' for example. Even movies like \\'Knocked Up\\' where a pot-smoking, video-gaming, narcissistic slob tries to turn his life around to try to be a father feels more contrived than real. These movies forget about human feelings. Who cares about stock or cartoonish characters in love. The couple in (500) Days of Summer have true chemistry. There are some beautiful, subtle moments of tenderness as well as some heart- rending moments of disconnectedness between the two that never comes across as heavy-handed. The movie constantly reminds you that these are two different people with different ideas of a relationship, yet they stubbornly continue dating, and they remain lovable all the same.An omniscient narrator sets the film up early on by noting \"this is not a love story.\" And, in a way, it isn\\'t. It\\'s a story about feelings. It just so happens (500) Days of Summer captures the sensation of falling in love better than most movies.For more of my reviews, visit indieethos.com',\n",
       " 'Rest assured, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing movie. I won\\'t dare spoil any of this remarkable movie for you but I do recommend it as highly as I possibly can. Marvel needed to get in to the solo movie making business long ago. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they\\'re making movies themselves. Most everyone knows Iron Man is their first effort and what a great lead off film! This movie helps take the comic book genre to the highest level. Just like they did in the books, they reinvent standard epic adventure by \"Marvelizing\" characters and making them more believable. The Spider-Man and the X-Men movies did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Director Sam Raimi pulled this off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them with the Spider-Man series. Jon Favreau has done the same thing here but I think he\\'s done it even better. Raimi intentionally threw in a little cheese. Favreau adds nice bits of humor but not too much. He also grounds the action and the suit of armor in firm reality. I\\'ve said it before but it\\'s brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Favreau delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr. and company deliver the goods. It\\'s a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun.The amazing yet realistic action is paced by the plot and characters that keep you interested from start to finish. What absolutely blew me away were the phenomenal special effects. I know they built a practical, working armor. What I loved is the use of CGI was used to augment the real life armor and not create something from scratch. Most all CGI constructs feel fake somehow but the stuff in Iron Man didn\\'t seem fake even for an instant. As great as everything looked, what really drives the movie is the emotional resonance and down to earth nature of the plot. Sure the concept is wild but it\\'s all presented so that you really believe it could happen. I doubt anyone will find fault with this movie unless they went in trying to dislike it.This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2008, quite possibly the number one film.',\n",

Hugh Jackman is absolutely incredible as Jean Valjean and carries the film with spectacular grace. Anne Hathaway is magnificent in her fleeting role as Fantine - the film's sequence in which she goes on a downward spiral is one of the it's best moments, and her ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE HEARTFELT rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream' will win her the Oscar by itself.Also, a great supporting turn from newcomer Samantha Barks as the heartbroken Eponine (look out for her waist - it's absolutely tiny!), who is sure to be shot into stardom. Eddie Redmayne, Russell Crowe and Aaron Tveit are also good, and there's some great comedy relief from Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen.It will leave you laughing, crying, and feeling inspired.

Whereas the latter spoofed obsessed fans who take sci-fi entertainment WAY too seriously, this one spoofs the paranoid, tin-foil-hat brand of conspiracy theorists. It has funny characters, witty lines, and does not at all take itself seriously.There are a lot of small details that can take multiple viewings to catch. One thing I found funnier the second time I watched it is the scene where Will Smith has just been severely lectured by his boss in the interrogation room when Tommy Lee Jones enters, asks a few questions, and tells Smith to come with him. Smith: \"I can\\'t, there\\'s still a lot of paperwork to fill out.\" Jones: \"No, the paperwork is all taken care of.\" Smith\\'s boss (walking by): \"Hey, nice work, Edwards!\" This is one of many quick, funny scenes that you only really get if you\\'re paying attention.All the actors do a good job, too. I thought Rip Torn was the funniest character, and Edgar the bug was hilariously gross. Linda Fiorentino was one of the coolest female characters ever. She put Ripley to shame.

The action dimension is funny but realistic, and is played in reference and contrast to the Tom Cruise Mission Impossible franchise.

Sure, there are lot of legendary action sequences to be found, but RoboCop is a LOT more than that.Next time when you watch it, try to shift your focus from the cyborgs, explosions and gore towards the writing. From the main theme of criticizing the modern money driven society (a topic still relevant today, and will most likely be so in the future as well) all the way to the smallest bits of dialogue, the writing is nothing short of outstanding. RoboCop is simply the most intelligent \"action\" film to come out of Hollywood, ever. Unfortunately, the cleverness is hidden \"between the lines\" of comic book action. No wonder so many people fail to see this film for what it really is.Amazing cinematography, solid performances (especially from Kurtwood Smith and Miguel Ferrer), memorable musical score.. The list is endless. Granted, the stop motion effects of ED-209 look quite old today, but you have to remember we\\'re talking about a movie made in 1987. RoboCop has its faults, like the rather embarrassing toxic waste scene, but they are easily forgiven compared to all the good things.You must be thinking \"What is this guy on? It\\'s just a dumb little action flick about a cyborg!\" .. Relax, take a deep breath and watch it again.

I\\'m not saying RoboCop is art, the best movie ever made or the most important film of the year/decade/millennium.

The acting is light, fun, playful while also managing to stay true to the original story. There is a little too much of the side stores for my liking. And it could well have been cut by a half hour or so and still not lost any of it impact and appeal.Martin Freeman is a revelation. Knowing him from The Office (I lived in the UK for a while) it hardly seemed plausible that he could carry off such a role, but he is very believable. The merry band of dwarfs are well played and you somehow get to know each of them by the end of the film. The special effects are, well, special. We were ducking as rocks and boulders came flying out at us and I swear there was a bird floating over our heads at one point. The surround sound was rich and evocative of the caves and the music is lush and emotional.As for the main story, well, apart from doing a prelude that reprises the role of Frodo and older Bilbo Baggins, it pretty much stays true to the text - with some audience members anticipating what the characters were going to say next.A word of warning - some of the battle scenes are very intense, made more so by the 3D and high definition used along with the sound effects. You may want to think long and hard about taking young kids to it.But for everyone else, particularly the young at heart, this first installment of The Hobbit is a gem.(note: I was very fortunate to see The Hobbit in Wellington last week.

The action sequences are fairly average for the most part and I really never got that \"edge of my seat\" feeling as the characters faced peril.All in all, an above-average film which could have been great if someone with better directing chops had been chosen.6/10',\n",

People who complain about films like this should spend more time at the library and less time at the cinema, and even less time telling everyone else how smart they are and how silly films like this are beneath them.

       " 'I\\'m uncertain why the daughter of a Hollywood icon would select as her first director effort a nearly unfilmable book of linguistic time bombs and nearly unspeakable tragedy. Jeffrey Eugenides\\'s book The Virgin Suicides is one of the underappreciated gems of the 1990s and surely Sophia Coppola must have known that the critics would have it out for anything she did (see reviews listed under \"acting: Part 3, The Godfather\"). So Coppola, daughter of Francis Ford, decided to do something unexpected: She made a gem of a movie that\\'s easy to like and complex enough to savour.Taking place \"25 years ago\" in \"Michigan,\" The Virgin Suicides tells the story of a group of teenage boys and the Lisbon sisters, whose suicides changed them forever. The book is told with a rather unique choral narrator (the entire story is in the first person plural) which makes it clear that the focus of the story is not the Lisbons, but the boys and their attempts to restructure the events of what must have been their final summer of innocence. Similarly, the film features extensive voice-overs, culled from the book, coming from an unidentified member (or members) of the gang. You might wonder why you\\'re never able to distinguish between any of the four or five or six males who wander through the story, or why at least several of the Lisbon girls also blend together, but rest assured it\\'s intentional. The Virgin Suicides is very much about a baffled collective.The movie begins with the first suicide attempt of the youngest Lisbon girl. When the doctor examining her asks why should would try to kill herself she offers the simple response, \"Obviously, Doctor, you have never been a thirteen year old girl.\" The book and film are both really about men and how incapable we are of understand what it\\'s like to be a thirteen year old girl or a thirty year old woman or really anything in between. And what\\'s even more frustrating is the fact that women seem to understand men so devastatingly well (a trait perfectly personified in Kirsten Dunst\\'s portrayal of middle sister Lux). The narrative such as it is marches inexorably through the gradual awakening of the narrators and the inevitable realization that they never knew anything.Coppola, who also adapted the screenplay, makes decent use of the book\\'s two metaphorical subplots -- an outbreak of Dutch Elm Disease and a cemetery worker\\'s strike. The rot of suburban life lies at the core of this story and Coppola wisely never overplays her hand. She loves using mythic imagery, generally revolving around Dunst, an actress beginning to produce the kind of resume that speaks of longevity. Coppola\\'s background in costuming is also evident, displaying the decadence and tackiness of the observing characters, contrasted with the spare Puritainism of the Lisbons.Coppola gets mostly good performances from the young generation of her cast. As the only two characters to get individual notice, Dunst and Josh Hartnett do excellent work. She\\'s the animal core of the film and he perfectly captures the perplexed, corrupted purity of the male side of the story. Playing against type, James Woods is excellent as the Lisbon\\'s introverted henpecked father and Kathleen Turner is effectively scary as their domineering mother.The film is also aided by some wonderful technical work including Jasna Stefanovic\\'s nostalgic, but never cutesy production design and Edward Lachman\\'s versatile cinematography. The soundtrack by the French band Air is also notable, mixed with various hit songs from the period.The Virgin Suicides has perhaps too many moments of whimsy, where it seems too devoted to its source, even when the material doesn\\'t translate properly. But still, it\\'s the moments of magic -- the Lisbon girls prom, an eerie family party, and phone conversation spoken only with records -- that stand out. I\\'d give this one an 8/10.',\n",
       " '(Gonna try not to cuss) I will start by saying I was/am fanatical about all three of the first ones. Yes the original is still the best, but the second is almost every damn bit as good. The plot was creative enough that it felt necessary, the writing was on par with the first, and Davy Jones is SO freaking good oh my god he is literally my favorite villain of all time (save for Agent Smith). The third one has its flaws (though I really can\\'t think of any besides Keira Knightley\\'s acting being occasionally over the top), but as a whole it\\'s a WONDERFUL movie. Like sweet Jesus, Hans Zimmer\\'s freaking score for that movie alone is goddamn legendary. And as a result I totally bought into the romance between Will & Elizabeth and really just felt an emotional connection to the whole series because of it (much like the emotion Howard Shore\\'s music invokes for LotR). But what makes the third one so impressive is how well it handles ALL of that crazy plot while still introducing great new sh*t like the Brethren Court. But I\\'m not here to talk about how great the original trilogy was. Odds are, most of you liked them too. What I want to talk about briefly before I tear Dead Men Tell No Tales to shreds, is On Stranger Tides. From what I gather, the fourth installment was/is NOT very popular. I like it. And I\\'ll tell you why. While it didn\\'t have the same epic sense of scale and adventure and romance and everything that made the first three so great, IT STILL HAD GOOD WRITING. It was clever, and witty, and funny as ever. And this is because Ted & Terry were still writing them, not FRICKING Jeff Nathanson. OMFG I\\'ll get to him later. I would urge you though to go back and give On Stranger Tides another chance, especially if you\\'ve now seen the fifth installment. I think you\\'ll find that even though it doesn\\'t quite hold up against the first three it still FEELS like a Pirates of the Caribbean, and for all the reasons that Dead Men Tell No Tales did not, and here they are:1) Johnny Depp has completely lost it. It\\'s like he forgot how to play Jack Sparrow. There were seriously times watching him when I thought he was more Mad Hatter than he was Jack Sparrow. And it\\'s so sad to watch. The old Jack was an idiot sure, but he was always clever, he was always suave, always cool. In this he\\'s just silly. It\\'s embarrassing. I\\'m serious when I say he acts like the Mad Hatter, you\\'ll see what I mean. In the fourth one he at least still felt like Jack Sparrow.2) Zimmer\\'s so called \"protege\" Geoff Zanelli is so forgettable. I was actually trying to listen for his music but the only times the music stood out was when he was rehashing Zimmer\\'s themes. And some of you may be like *sissy voice \"oh that\\'s all Zimmer did was rehash Badelt\\'s themes\". BISH PLEASE. Not only did he make Badelt\\'s original theme sound even better, he introduced so many new ones (Jack\\'s theme, Davy Jones\\' theme, Will & Elizabeth\\'s theme). Even On Stranger Tides added a fun new Spanish twist to the old stuff.3) Salazar, Henry, & Carina are also all completely forgettable. They\\'re worse than Blackbeard (who I actually quite liked), Philip, and Syrena. There is hardly ANY character development for them and what little there was felt SO forced. I feel terrible for them (especially Thwaites and Bardem) because they\\'re not bad actors (Bardem is actually a fantastic actor) but they just got saddled with one of the WORST freaking scripts of all time, which brings me to my final and primary complaint with the fifth installment.4) JEFF NATHANSON IS CANCER. I mean my biggest (only) concerns from the start (because let\\'s be honest the trailer\\'s gave NO hint that the movie would be this bad) were the fact that Zimmer wasn\\'t composing and that JEFF NATHANSON, the idiot who ruined Indiana Jones, was writing it, but I NEVER thought he could have F\\'d up this movie, not as badly as he did. Like, the movie had SO much going for it. Salazar could have been another great villain to put alongside Jones and Barbossa, but he was totally wasted with minimal and poor dialogue. Carina Smith, a female astronomer, could have been a GREAT female character! And her romance with Henry could have been done BEAUTIFULLY! Instead, what did we get? Well, I won\\'t spoil it for you but I will say there is one of the most forced, predictable, and painstakingly banal twists I\\'ve ever seen in a movie regarding her character.So, as I said, I absolutely LOVED the first three, and I really did like the fourth one. Enough that I was very excited about what they could do with the next one (the fifth one). All my friends said the franchise was dead but I maintained that the fifth installment had the potential to be amazing (which it did). And I waited SIX GODDAMNED YEARS for this fifth one. And it, was just, god, awful. So bad that I actually now don\\'t want to see another installment, and I will honestly probably never watch it again because it\\'s so bad that it almost taints my love for the first four.I tried to think of reasons to give it more than the lowest possible rating, any reason. And ALL I could think of was the visual quality that the two Norwegian directors brought to it, so good for them, I give the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean a whopping two stars. Thank you. This has been my angrily hastened unedited review of Dead Men Tell No Tales.',\n",
       " 'I just want to start off by saying this is an amazing film about young love that is actually honest with its audience. There are countless of films about people falling in love, but when you see \"Blue is the Warmest Colour\". You realize just how rare films are that make a sincere attempt to catch what it really is like to fall for someone, without sentimentality, forced cuteness or cheap emotional manipulation. This is the rare love story that has real emotional truth about it. The fact that it is about two women who fall for each other is almost secondary to the way the film catches the universality of what it is like to fall in love and maintain the relationship. \"Blue is the Warmest Colour is a naturalistic and touching film, whether you\\'re gay, straight, bisexual, or whatever orientation. This is a film that can give you relationship advice and life guidance no matter what your orientation may be. It isn\\'t an indulgent film bringing only a unique gay relationship to light and nothing more, and it isn\\'t an ode to \"coming out\" and stockpiled clichés of \"being different.\" It shows how an interaction with a person can have a truly provocative impact on you as a person.The struggles between the two lovers is depicted in breathtaking detail. The director masterfully captures all of the turmoil and hardship going on between Adele\\'s and Emma\\'s relationship. The movie\\'s long running time does not effect the film at all because you are so immersed into their characters. The sexual realization of Adele is perfectly shown in the movie. She is confused and doesn\\'t know what she wants, it is a typical teenage problem. This movie is ultimately about Adele and her struggles to find her true self. The transformation that she experiences is utterly engrossing to watch. The film\\'s nearly three hour running time is devoted to showing the growth of her character and it is absolutely amazing to watch it unfold right in front of your eyes.The intimate scene\\'s between Adele and Emma are nothing short of miraculous in their depth and their honesty. The conversations are heartfelt, and the pain is evident and shared. It\\'s realism of the world we live in is honest and raw.The movie owes so much of it\\'s emotional power to its two fantastic actresses. They really bring it their all in this. I\\'ve never had doubts of these two performances, the characters felt like real people and you felt so much for their relationship. Their emotional hardships feel completely real. The character\\'s flaws and insecurities feel so authentic because you actually believe them as real human beings. We never lose sight of their chemistry and devotion to one another, even in the most difficult of times. The two of them are like fireworks, waiting to explode out. I cannot recommend this film enough to those of you out there who are interested in seeing this. This is one of the wisest and least condescending films I\\'ve seen this year. I congratulate the director, Abdellatif Kechiche and the two actresses, Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux for an emotional and spiritual journey that had me compelled to the screen for 179 glorious minutes.',\n",
       " \"Point Break is one of those films that everybody loves, but that nobody actually talks about all that often. It is a film that if you mention it in conversation, everyone else around is bound to say how much they enjoyed it.The film's two main assets are unexpected ones, in the form of the direction and  the script. The direction by Kathryn Bigelow is nothing short of excellent. Her handling of the action and suspense scenes is exciting and riveting. The two sky-diving scenes are brilliant as is the foot chase through the streets (and houses) of the city. The script, by W. Peter Illif, is also very good and the best thing about the film. The plot is multi-layered and has an original relationship between the hero and the villain. The way the story resolves itself and the ultimate resolutions is excellent, by the standards of most Hollywood action films.This film deserves to be remembered as one of the better actioners of the nineties, not up there with Die Hard 2/3 or Speed, but better than 90% of the action junk made nowadays. At least this film has a plot.\",\n",
       " \"I'm a huge fan of Dumas and The Three Musketeers is one of my favorite books. I have been watching various adaptations for years hoping one of them will finally get it right. I was particularly hopeful about this one - I thought if anyone can do it justice it should be the French.For an adaptation of classic novel to be good it must be faithful to the original source material and not make unnecessary alterations to the plot.It must also adequately capture the atmosphere of the time period, the main theme and the essence of the book - which to me was honor, loyalty and friendship.Another very important requirement is proper character development. And for that to truly work the actors should look like the characters as described in the book and be approximately the same age (or at least look that age).In terms of casting - I'd give this adaptation a 3/10.I know Vincent Casel is a good actor but he is 57 years old!!! He could have played another character. Why did they cast him as Athos? Athos is supposed to be 27-29 and very handsome (I know this is highly subjective but still).The actor playing Aramis is also 50 when he should be 22-23. He is not attractive or charming either and Aramis is supposed to be the best looking one of the bunch (at least most other adaptations get this right).For some reason everyone loves Eva Green - she maybe great in other movies but I don't like her as Milady at all. Milady is supposed to be intoxicatingly beautiful and blonde. This actress has jet black hair and is rather plain looking. I have no idea why the director made her smoke a pipe - this just makes her look like a cartoon villain.They also made Porthos bisexual. Think of that what you will - I personally find if ridiculous.If that wasn't enough to disappoint all hard core fans of the book - the plot has been drastically changed.It's annoying because they have kept some parts very close to the book and created this illusion of authenticity. The cinematography is cool looking and the setting has a realistic feel. I like that it is not a slapstick comedy like some of the other adaptation attempts. That being said - the camera angles are a bit weird. They put you in the middle of the duels so you can't get a good feel of what's happening. And the editing is very choppy.Overall I don't regret watching this film but I can't say that I liked it.I guess I'll have to wait another 3-5 years until someone attempts to adapt this book again - maybe they will finally get it right.\",\n",
       " '5 reasons to love this film: 1. The sight of Ned Nederlander (Martin Short) telling the incomprehensible, self-indulgent story of when he met Dorothy Gish (\"you know, Lillian\\'s sister\") to a bunch of patient, albeit bored Mexican kids. 2. Lucky Day (Steve Martin) trying to get his buddies\\' attention as they break into the studio--progressing from an owl\\'s soft \"hoo\" to a crowing \"LOOKUPHERE...LOOKUPHERE\" 3. The opening song and Elmer Bernstein\\'s great score (he also scored the classic comedies \"Animal House\" and \"Stripes\") 4. The Three Amigos singing \"My Little Buttercup\" in a Mexican cantina 5. The Amigos fighting back tears as Lucky Day informs his buddies that, in fact, they have been summoned not to perform, but actually to fight the evil El Guapo--Martin Short\\'s tearful line, \"Why am I in Mexico?\" is hilarious, almost as funny as Steve Martin\\'s follow-up, \"I\\'ve been shot already!\"This is an intelligent comedy, one that pokes fun not only at the mythology of the Hollywood western, but at Hollywood itself. The three Amigos is a delight to watch, and a great addition to any family\\'s film collection.',\n",
       " 'If there\\'s anything this movie proves, it is the difficulty in separating the series from the demands of fans. This is clear just from hearing some of the comments. \"Why didn\\'t they identify the names on the Marauder\\'s Map?\" \"Why wasn\\'t the second Quidditch game shown?\" \"Why wasn\\'t there more of Crookshanks the Cat?\" By focusing on what the film didn\\'t have, fans fail to look at the film on its own terms. I think this is by far the best Harry Potter movie yet.The only way to satisfy fans would be to include everything from the book, which would require a miniseries. Since that isn\\'t what these films are, the story has to be abridged. The first two films tried to fit everything they could within a reasonable slot of time. The result was a set of films that felt cluttered yet incomplete. Had they continued with this strategy for this movie, based on a much longer book, it would surely have been over three hours long.The virtue of the latest film is that it makes a real attempt to adapt the story, not just marching in lockstep with the book\\'s events. The screenplay is sparing, leaving out or simplifying loads of details not directly relevant to the plot. But it captures much of the book\\'s delight and humor. The first two films fell short in this regard, because they lacked the guts to tinker with the details, even though that was the key to condensing the story while staying true to its spirit.The movie is still faithful to the book, of course. Many of the scenes are exactly as I had imagined them. When it deviates, it does so based on an understanding of the story and characters. This is evident in the way they show, for example, the Knight Bus; Hermione\\'s overstuffed schedule; and the introduction of the Marauder\\'s Map, a scene that captures the twins\\' mischievous personalities. The changes are clever and funny, and they help compensate for the movie\\'s loss in other areas.Certainly this has something to do with the new director. Columbus\\'s approach was to stick to the books as literally as possible, often draining them of their subtlety. For instance, where the books only hint that Dumbledore can see through the invisibility cloak, the earlier movies make it unmistakable. The new director never condescends to the audience in that way. This is a children\\'s movie, but it is also a fantasy-thriller that we can take seriously, because not everything is spelled out for us. We\\'re given a chance to think.But part of what makes the movie work is the book itself. The story is gripping from start to finish, because the threat looming over the school is established early on. Harry\\'s personal life is sharply intertwined with the plot. We feel for him as we watch his disastrous (but hilarious) attempts to escape his uncle and aunt, and his humiliating reaction to the dementors. The story avoids common devices such as the talking killer or deus ex machina, which the other books have in abundance. The ending is nicely bittersweet and ambiguous. The plot is so complicated, however, that the book spends several chapters explaining it all. The movie wisely includes only very little of this, allowing the plot twists to become understood as the story progresses. I was surprised to see certain events that were in the movie but not the book lend support to an important theory some fans have had about what is to be revealed at the end of the series. Of course, it is well-hidden and won\\'t give anything away for those who aren\\'t looking for the clues.I was so satisfied with the film that it almost seems trivial to mention the flaws, but there are some. The portrayal of Fudge\\'s assistant as the standard hunchbacked dimwit is out of place here, as it would be in anything other than a cartoon or spoof. The most serious misstep, though, is the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Gambon\\'s face seems frozen in a perpetual nonexpression, and his voice lacks resonance. He compares poorly to the late Richard Harris, whose line readings had gravity, and who played the character with a twinkle in his eyes. It is a pure mystery to me why this actor was chosen as a replacement, especially considering the fine performances from other members of the cast. Even the children are in top form here.Those complaints aside, this is the movie I was hoping they would make when the series began. If it doesn\\'t live up to the book, so what? What\\'s important is that it lives up to its potential as a movie. Fans who want a carbon-copy of the book are looking in the wrong place, because they\\'re never going to get it here. This is probably the best example of a Harry Potter movie that we\\'re ever likely to see.',\n",
       " 'Tilda Swinton is an academic who studies stories. She lives a fairly isolated existence ... by choice ... valuing her independence over close relationships.

Naturally, he tells her she has three wishes, but as she\\'s an expert on stories, she\\'s wary since all the stories she knows about wishing are cautionary tales. Since he needs her to make wishes to be free, Elba tells her stories about his past to explain how he ended up in the bottle and to build trust.The advertising for this film is deceptive.

This is nothing like that film. It\\'s a pretty stately paced film that mostly involves Swinton and Elba talking in a hotel room, with Elba\\'s stories providing the magnificent visuals. But even these stories are pretty deliberately paced. It\\'s a film about ideas, not action.I really liked the ideas. It\\'s about the role of stories in life and also about love and companionship.

       " 'The Revenant falls into the same category as Aronofsky\\'s \"Requiem for a Dream\" and Spielberg\\'s \"Schindler\\'s List\" for me, in the essence of being a terrific movie but not something I think I can sit through a second time. In all these movies there are brutal sequences that cause emotional stress and disgust just watching because it is so REAL and GRIPPING. To think that events in these movies actually happened or that they could very well happen is too much for me to think about. Not to say that I did not enjoy this film thoroughly. The Revenant is a technical masterpiece that left me wondering \"How the hell did they do that?\" after many scenes and sequences. With beautiful cinematography and adroit camera movement this film is a visual magnum opus. It is apparent that the great minds that put forth this film are none other than the same ones that brought us Birdman: Lubezki and Inarritu. There are many long shots without cuts that are sprinkled throughout the film that add a sense of sophistication to it with the added bonus of predominantly location based shooting and natural lighting for the film , that can even make a novice film watcher raise an eyebrow at its complexity. The camera work is not the only noteworthy aspect of the film; The actors did a superb job executing their rolls. Many are raving about DiCaprio\\'s performance but I was more of a fan of Hardy\\'s brutal and gritty character Fitzgerald. Granted, half the words that came out of his mouth were unintelligible but he left no doubt in my mind that he was fully devoted to his role and bringing Fitzgerald alive instead of just Hardy playing a character named Fitzgerald. He was simply amazing.With all this said, there are still flaws in the film. At some points it was dragging on and moving too slow. It gave the impression that the film itself was cocky and wanted to show off all of its beautiful scenery and camera work too much. Then there was the \"he shouldn\\'t be alive\" situations. Hugh Glass was a real guy that really did survive a bear mauling but in the film they make this guy practically immortal. There were too many instances where I was thinking \"he should be dead three times over right now, for me to enjoy the film as much I should have. All in all a great film that I only recommend to seasoned and mature film viewers.',\n",

In a three way spy battle, I would put Neeson edging out Bourne, who would be a step ahead of Bond.Between the jaw-dropping action sequences was the subject matter of international trafficking, which was pretty miserable to watch. Although killing is wrong, death was never more satisfying to watch.\",\n",
       " 'Last night COL Ferry and I (COL Coldwell, both USA) were able to watch the new WWI film, 1917, before it has national release. It is a cinematographic feast for the eyes, long expansive shots that follow the protagonists as they execute their mission. It does not hide the horrors that existed in trench warfare, it shows them for their brutality and abundance. (My great uncle died as a consequence of his service fighting in the trenches, mustard gas poisoning). In many ways it reminded me of Saving Private Ryan.For those who have served in combat (I have deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan), I cannot tell you if the film will be too difficult to watch, it might well be, especially if incoming artillery is a trigger. For me, as the camera travels a few inches above the dirt advancing slowly up a berm, my response was visceral. I was taken back to the patrols we walked in Afghanistan, not knowing what was around the corner; not relaxing heightened vigilance, not knowing if there would be an IED, a child wearing a suicide vest, a sniper taking aim. For the protagonists in this film (as for all who served and are serving) surviving the climb up the berm, there is no sigh of relief, no respite from the fear of uncertainty. They (we) survive to move forward to face more uncertainty.Watching allowed me to pay homage to my great uncle, and the approximate 800,000 other Brits who were killed or died as a consequence of their service. (Germany lost over 2 million soldiers in the war). Estimates put the total casualty numbers for both military and civilians at 40 million, half killed or died from wounds/infection.I rate this film as 10/10, for many reasons. Directing, acting, set design, cinematography, musical score, the raw emotion it invokes. Some critics have said they never felt a connection with the characters, I suspect they never served in combat. While the brotherhood (including female War Fighters) is strong, there is also a common characteristic possessed by all War Fighters, the ability to focus on a mission and suppress emotion, even as those around the Fighter fall. This was the quality I recognized in the actors and why the viewer doesn\\'t \"bond\" with the main protagonists; we, the viewer, were on the mission with them, we grieve as we can and move on.Watch if you will, but know there is no pleasure in watching and the film will grab you and the beginning and not let you go. Even though we know the outcome of WWI, there is no joy, there is no peace. Watch because it will allow you a glimpse at the horror and brutality of war; reflect on their service and sacrifice. Note, as we (the viewer) are \"walking\" through the trenches, glancing shots of the young soldiers shows them with flat affect, isolation, almost apathy; this is the face of \"shell shock,\" what we know call post-traumatic stress disorder.For original WW1 footage, watch \"They Shall Never Grow Old,\" an exceptional documentary.',\n",
       " 'First of all, if you are expecting the stereotypical monster movie where the point of it is just watching a monster destroy stuff and watch people running around, you WILL be disappointed. The majority of this film takes place in offices and meeting rooms.Japan just went through a nation-wide Earthquake that took more than 15,000 lives, and triggered the second worst nuclear meltdown in history, both just five years ago. And this is a clear satire on the sociopolitical events since. The film takes us through what goes on in the government when a unprecedented crisis hits the nation. It\\'s a bunch of long meetings, finger-pointing, paperwork, and slow decision-making. It is the epitome of dysfunctional bureaucracy. On top of all that, you start to see the US government and other UN nations start to poke their heads into the matter, treating the hometown of 15 million Japanese people like just another battleground for just another war. There are no clear-cut heroes; Just a group of normal people who are experts in their own fields, doing their best to contribute and put this disaster to an end. They have to fight the politics more than the actual monster. The reality of all of this is astonishing, and completely believable. It starts to feel like a crisis simulation film. But of course, the center of it all is Godzilla:Godzilla himself is truly awe-inspiring in this film. What they have done with the monster is totally new, different from any of the Godzillas in the past (be careful of spoilers out there on the web if you want to experience the amazement). It\\'s personally my favorite by far. Throughout the film, Godzilla is dubbed as \"The truly perfect organism\", \"The most evolved being on the planet\", and \"A god\". So that is the level which you should expect. His crazy power is far beyond belief, so you can safely immerse yourself into this fictional monster. The tag-line for \"Godzilla Resurgence\" in Japan reads: \"Reality(Japan) V.S. Fiction(Godzilla)\". So you are witnessing the fault line between reality and fiction.When Godzilla is turning the city of Tokyo into rubble, the Japanese don\\'t see fiction. They see the events of 2011/03/11. The director clearly took measures to parallel the tsunamis, the rubble, and the fear of radiation to the events in real life.Put that together with the bureaucratic mess, the international politics, and terror/awesomeness of the devastating monster Godzilla; The result is this masterpiece. It\\'s a movie clearly wouldn\\'t have come out from the Hollywood scene.It does have it\\'s faults (like Satomi Ishihara\\'s cartoonish character), but the impact and significance of the film far surpasses its faults. A must-watch.',\n",

This one is easily the most banal mostly thanks to the dryest of the dry ,Seth Rogen. I don't know how that guy ever even got his foot in the door to Hollywood because he is one of the most unfunny people around. The casting is also horrendously bad especially for the turtles themselves. Each one of the voice actors is not even close to the personality that should be brought to each of the individual turtles. The odd changes they made for certain characters and what they look like seem so desperately forced it's sickening. The only interesting factor of this film is the animation style which is just a rip off of the recemt also overrated spiderverse. At least some of it looks somewhat cool. Overall though this is what I thought it would be and it's pretty sad one of the Michael bay TMNT films are way more serviceable even when they're not even passable.\",\n",

       " 'I\\'m sorry to say The Avengers isn\\'t a good movie; it\\'s a GREAT  MOVIE!!!! It\\'s not only the best team superhero movie ever made, but it  may just be the best comic book adaption made period!  The Avengers is the culmination of what began in Iron Man; and  continued through The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain  America. It was only a few years ago that my son and I had just  finished watching Iron Man and as the credits were ending, Samuel L.  Jackson appeared on screen as Nick Fury and spoke to Tony Stark about  joining Avengers Initiative\\x85in that short scene, the framework for  potentially the greatest comic book movie of all-time had begun!   Director Joss Whedon, most known for the T.V. series Buffy The Vampire  Slayer, takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and  brings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history, The  Avengers: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain  America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk/Bruce  Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye  (Jeremy Renner) as \"assembled\" by Nick Fury. Whedon\\'s scripts usually  include clever banter, gripping action sequences and an air of mystery  and The Avengers is no different. Whedon has an utter love for comic  books, and it is proudly put on display in The Avengers.  The cast does a great job of bringing these iconic characters to life,  beginning with Robert Downey Jr. Unlike Iron Man 2, in which Downey  seemed to skate through scene after scene, Downey plays Stark almost  effortlessly, delivering his lines with relative ease allowing his  charisma, charm and smugness to shine through; Robert Downey Jr. IS  Tony Stark! Chris Evans\\' solidifies himself in the role of Captain  America. He was very good in his solo film, but truly owns the role  standing alongside Iron Man and Thor. Chris Hemsworth\\'s Asgardian god  Thor has some incredible battle scenes and indirectly provides one of  the film\\'s most funny moments. After being seriously underutilized in  Iron Man 2, Scarlett Johansson\\'s Black Widow is provided a back-story,  which helps in developing the character and provides an opportunity to  prove she is much more than just a pretty face; she\\'s as dangerous  psychologically as she is physically. I could envision myself enjoying  a beat-down at the hands (and feet) of Black Widow. The character I was  most concerned about being given little story and the least amount of  screen time was Jeremy Renner\\'s Hawkeye; happily, he\\'s not left by the  wayside and does a more than admirable job of developing the character.  Hawkeye stands alongside Robin Hood and Katniss Everdene (The Hunger  Games) as the best archers to grace the silver screen. I\\'d like to see  more of him in a film of his own. Mark Ruffalo, the most recent choice  to play Hulk, is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana (The  Hulk) and Ed Norton Jr (The Incredible Hulk). Ruffalo looks more the  part of the nerdy scientist Banner and plays the part without looking  angry in every scene. In The Avengers, the Hulk is at his most  impressive, both in his on-screen transformation and the violence he  displays when the opportunity calls for him to \"hulk out\". If any  character appeared to stand out a little bit more than the others, for  me it was the Hulk. Samuel L. Jackson\\'s Nick Fury is finally more than  just the guy making surprise appearances. Fury is finally able to  stretch his legs some, and Jackson slides quite easily into the role.  Clark Gregg\\'s Agent Caulson returns, and Cobie Smulders makes her  Marvel films debut as Agent Maria Hill, and she is a welcome addition.  The film\\'s main villain is Thor\\'s adopted-brother Loki, played by Tom  Hiddleston. You would think the part would be a difficult one to play  being opposite such powerful personalities and strong characters, but  Hiddleston does a fantastic job; the performance should not go  unnoticed, because it\\'s one of the strong points of the film. Loki is  not a villain without purpose and Hiddleston comes across as a devious  mastermind without being cartoonish.  At a running-time of 2+ hours, The Avengers is well paced and time  flies by. The effects are top-notch, the acting is very good, and the  script drives the movie elevating its strengths. For viewers that may  not have seen any of the other films (and if so, why not!?!?), we\\'re  provided just enough information to bring everyone up to speed without  feeling overdone. Whedon provides more than just a standard comic book  film, but a story with reason that\\'s backed up with incredible action  and humor.   Although the film is filled with larger than life characters, none are  short changed; each character is given at least one great scene to work  with, and the opportunities don\\'t go to waste. The film\\'s finale  provides a deafening crescendo of action that is breathtaking. As usual  with Marvel films, be sure to stay around for the post credit sequence,  which provides a surprising reveal.  I went into The Avengers with unfairly high expectations, due to all of  those that were involved, as well as the films that came before it.  After viewing the initial trailers and not being blown away, I had set  myself up for disappointment. It was only a matter of minutes after the  film started that I was put at ease, and just minutes later when my  expectations were blown away. I never imagined that it was possible to  put onto the screen, what I was watching. I\\'m happy that Marvel had the  sense to keep these properties to themselves and to move forward with  these characters in the manner in which they did. Marvel Studios and  Disney are going to make a boatload of money off this film, and  deservedly so; because there\\'s never been another movie made of its  caliber.  Grade: A+',\n",

(I'm still trying to figure out a local Best Buy displaying a large number of DVD's  as if it was the latest Adam Sandler movie)It is not an easy movie to watch but as an examination of what people are capable and how violence can come from nowhere and from the unexpected its a masterpiece.

And given that's the focus, it's pretty worthless overall.The story is nonexistent, or at least unimportant. It's about a survivalist sometime between 1500 and 1900, maybe. It only exists to serve the creation of a series of gags that aren't funny, clever, creative, or witty. Many of these revolve around beavers; or, more accurately, humans dressed in beaver costumes.

Also no.If you saw any of the post-Naked Gun movies Leslie Nielsen did, where the gags were incredibly forced and painful to watch, you'll have a good idea of this movie's sense of humor.

       " 'Special thanks to the Imaginative Film Festival in Toronto, Canada for inviting me to watch Fancy Dance!Synopsis: Following her sister\\'s disappearance, a Native American hustler kidnaps her niece from the child\\'s white grandparents and sets out for the state powwow in hopes of keeping what is left of their family intact. (Source: IMDb)\\nDirector Erica Tremblay presents such a unique story that discusses native land, native language, and the native community all through the beautiful relationship between an aunt and her niece.The film really starts off by slowly setting up the mood, tone, and vibe that it will follow throughout the whole film. It then reaches the middle of it which can be considered the weakest as it loses its balance in terms of hooking the audience to the story and the characters. However, the film gets itself together back again with the amazing final act that sets up the beautiful and emotional ending and the conclusion of the beautiful relationship between the aunt and her niece.Director Erica Tremblay and cinematographer Carolina Costa truly choose a bunch of different elements that will help portray and deliver the most accurate feelings that each character is going through using visuals, directing techniques, and camera movements.Two particular shots that grabbed my attention, one being an \"inside the frame\" shot of Jax (played by Lilly Gladstone) being in a phone call which captured her through a frame of a window. The shot added more nervousness into the scene by making it seem as a very narrow frame and the character is trapped in that small window frame.Another shot is a tense scene where one character finds out something that is not suppose to be shared with her from another character in which a line is visually shown using a wall\\'s corner where each character is standing on each side separating the two of them in half as if their relationship together is affected. It really reminded me how Bong Joon Ho used lines to separate the characters in Parasite (2019).Lily Gladstone\\'s acting and portraying of the character Jax is on point. The character has a cold heart with lots of worries, yet is a caring person and is an influencer specifically to her niece. It sets Lily Gladstone on the spotlight specifically on her most recent film Killers of The Flower Moon (2023) by Martin Scorsese.Isabel Deroy-Olson introduces to the audience an innocent niece who\\'s mother is missing as this is the actress\\' first feature film. This being her first feature film really tells a lot about her talent as her portraying of the different emotions and the optimistic daughter in hopes of her mother to be found. Those emotions really reached audience members throughout the whole this film.Fancy Dance ends off with a great closing credits song with beautiful lyrics that reflects on all the lives that we lost in which the lyrics say: \"Let\\'s put our minds together and reflect on those who have passed, those who are up the sky, those who are now living peacefully.\"Watched on Tuesday October 17th, 2023\\nFormat: regular theatre @ Imaginative Film Festival\\nRating: 8/10.',\n",

You will not regret it.\"Psycho\" is easily the best horror-thriller of all time. Nothing even comes close...maybe \"Les Diaboliques\" (1955) but not really.\"Psycho\" has one of the best scripts you\\'ll ever find in a movie. The movie\\'s only shortcoming is that one of the characters seems to have little motivation in the first act of the movie but as the story progresses, you realize that Hitchcock (GENIUS! GENIUS! GENIUS!) in a stroke of genius has done this on purpose, because there is another character whose motivations are even more important. Vitally important. So important that you totally forget about anything else. I was lucky enough to have spent my life wisely avoiding any conversation regarding the plot of this movie until I was able to see it in full. Thank God I did! The movie has arguably the best mid-plot point and climactic twist in thriller history, and certainly the best-directed ending. The last few shots are chilling and leave a lingering horror in the viewer\\'s mind.Just as good as the writing is Hitchcock\\'s direction, which is so outstanding that it defies explanation. Suffice it to say that this movie is probably the best directorial effort by film history\\'s best director. I was fortunate enough to see this movie at a big oldtime movie house during a Hitchcock revival. Janet Leigh, still radiant, spoke before the film and explained how Hitchcock\\'s genius was in his ability to 1) frighten without gore and 2) leave his indelible mark on the movie without overshadowing his actors (like the great Jean Renoir could never do). \"Psycho\" is clearly its own phenomenon, despite all the big-name talent involved.Hitchcock does not disappoint by leaving out his trademark dark humor. His brilliance is in making a climax that is at once both scary and hilarious. When I saw it in the theatre the audience was both gasping in disbelief while falling-on-the-floor laughing.One more thing...Tony Perkins. Janet Leigh got much-deserved accolades for this film, but it is Perkins who gives what remains the single best performance by an actor in a horror movie. He is so understated that his brillance passes you by. He becomes the character. The sheer brillance of the role is evidenced by the ineptitude of the actors in Gus Van Sant\\'s 1998 (dear God make it stop!) shot-for-shot \"remake.\" Though the movies are nearly identical, Hitchcock\\'s is superior mostly because of the acting and the atmosphere (some of the creepiness is lost with color). This is made obvious by the initial conversation between Leigh\\'s character and Perkins, a pivotal scene. The brilliance of Perkins in the original shines even brighter when compared with the ruination in the remake even though the words and the shots were exactly the same. The crucial chemistry in this scene lacking in the remake gives everything away and mars our understanding of upcoming events. The fact that Perkins could never escape this role - his star stopped rising star as it had done in the 50s - proves that he played the part perhaps too well.I keep using the word brilliant, but I cannot hide my enthusiasm for this movie. It is wholly unlike the overblown, overbudget, overlong fluff spewing all-too-often out of Hollywood today. \"Psycho\" is simple, well-crafted and just the right length.Eleven-and-a-half out of ten stars.',\n",

       " 'It\\'s a matter of some debate which volume of Quentin Tarantino\\'s \"Kill Bill\" is better. Let\\'s end the argument right now: David Carradine doesn\\'t even appear in \"Volume 1.\" Hasn\\'t the Academy mailed him his Best Supporting Actor Oscar already?In the first volume of \"Kill Bill,\" released only a few months before \"Vol. 2\" in the tail end of 2003, we met Uma Thurman, one peeded-off super-assassin taking out some folks from her past one at a time, with the occasional mega-posse thrown in for interest. \"Vol. 1\" had a lot of blood, violence, and wisecracks, and galloped across the screen like a rap video on steroids.\"Vol. 2\" is way different. It makes sense it\\'s a separate movie; the tone is such a departure from \"Vol. 1\" in two ways. One is style. Director Tarantino has fun stylistically quoting Sergio Leone and chop-fu cheapos from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Cinematic sampling is something he\\'s good at and enjoys, but in \"Vol. 2\" he doesn\\'t go as overboard as he does in \"Vol. 1.\" He pulls back and lets the plot breathe, rather than filling every spare second with a homage-cum-parody that maybe a dozen lucky fans will get. Maybe some here wish he\\'d pile it on a bit more, but they have to make do with the goofy Pei Mai sequence, which is a flashback and hence not jarring in its \"Vol. 1\"-style comic-book treatment. Throughout \"Vol. 2\" the emphasis is on storytelling and character-building, which is where it should be given we are now being asked to deepen our commitment of interest to these people. \"Vol. 1\" is okay for what it is, but its flash and action are no match for the depth and nuance of \"Vol. 2.\"This gets to the second different tonal difference between the films, which is emotional. It all comes back to the characters. They don\\'t quite become real people here, but they get close enough to get under your skin. Admittedly, the opening part of \"Vol. 2\" tests the viewer\\'s patience a bit, there\\'s some long bits that show the director hasn\\'t really mastered self-discipline, like with Thurman\\'s graveyard struggle, but the meandering usually has a purpose. Tarantino is building toward something here that has its payoff when Thurman\\'s character finally has her face-to-face showdown with Carradine\\'s Bill.From that moment forward to the end, this is the best Tarantino has ever been.Carradine and Thurman dominate the proceedings with two of the finest performances I\\'ve seen, certainly the best Tarantino has directed, playing off the mythology we\\'ve been taught in \"Vol. 1\" and developing resonances with the viewer both together and apart which will surprise those expecting a casual butt-kicking affair. We finally find out what Carradine means in the first line of \"Vol. 1\" where he tells a whimpering victim he is being masochistic, not sadistic, and its a powerful revelation, that this sinister baddie may have a heart buried under that cold exterior. Carradine is perfect in his phrasing, his pauses, the tired glint in his eye, or the way he says \"Kiddo.\" You can\\'t ask for a better veteran performance. For her part, Thurman presents a brilliantly conflicted character who can not stop either hating or loving Bill, and brings us not into a world of cartoon anguish, but real human pain.\"Kill Bill Vol. 2\" is slow-moving, and needs \"Vol. 1\" in a way few sequels do, since it assumes you know nearly all the characters coming in. That\\'s a weakness. So are some undeniably pointless bits, including the entire sequence with Bill\\'s father figure, Esteban Vihaio, and some business at a bar involving Michael Madsen, who plays a former assassin now gone to seed.Madsen\\'s good, though, and so\\'s Daryl Hannah as another rather mouthy assassin, Gordon Liu as Pei Mei, and especially Perla Haney-Jardine as a girl named B.B. The nice thing with Tarantino is for every scene that strikes a bum note, there\\'s four or five that hit the right mark, and some manage to do much more. My favorite scene involves a Mexican standoff in an L.A. hotel room between Thurman\\'s character and an anonymous hitwoman, at once grippingly suspenseful, hilarious, and life-affirming. Still, it\\'s the final moments of this film that will stay with you, as Bill and his former pupil work out their \"unfinished business\" and we are left to ponder the results of their decisions and actions.\"Kill Bill Vol. 2\" may not reach the heights of cinema to which it aspires, the level of \"The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly\" quoted in its score, but it\\'s a fine film that will make most viewers glad they stuck around for the second installment. I am.',\n",
       " \"Predator is definitely one of the best alien thrillers ever made. It is one of my personal favorite movies. When I first saw just a brief part of Predator when I was about five, I was freaked out and scared to even watch the movie for many ages, but eventually, once getting older, came to like it. The Predator, played by Kevin Peter Hall, is a very realistic and believable creature for the 1980s, when this movie was created. I like how humanlike its form is, and how un-humanlike it is at the same time. The creature's four mandibles were a great idea for its distinct facial characteristics and the creature's roar is awesome, one of the best ever produced. This movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Richard Chaves, Elipidi Carillo, Shane Black, and Sonny Landham and they are all believable in their roles and even add to the humor that this movie has. This is obviously the best of the Predator movies and still one of the most highly liked thrillers today. And let's all show respect for Kevin Peter Hall, who died a year after he had made Predator 2.\",\n",
       " \"This is my very first review on IMDB, but I feel this film merits recognition. First off, let me say this film is not for everyone (the guy who I fist bumped when we started the film walked out). Frankly, if we are being honest this is a bit of a niche film. Howeverly it is a gorgeous piece of cinema worth give attention to.The cinematography is gorgeous in every shot, and at times will honestly make you questionin what era the film was made in. The socre is somber and a great match with the the bleak tone constructed by Guadagnino. The acting is very well done, and stands strong throughout the film. I personally don't want to give the plot away, or any more information beyond what I have said.I for the life of me can't understand why fans of the original dislike this piece! If you love the uniqueness of the original Suspiria, and are willing to experience a new interpretation of the film I genuinely think you'll have a blast!\",\n",
       " '\"I see what you\\'re going for, but it\\'s not really working.\" This was my feeling numerous times during this movie. So many things feel off or ingenuine. Almost like it\\'s a \"factory-made\" movie rather than something hand-crafted.I didn\\'t care about the characters. There are lots of stupid moments and things that make you raise an eyebrow. The treasure hunting stuff feels so random like they are making it up on the spot. The comedy isn\\'t terrible, it made me smirk a bunch of times. But I don\\'t think I laughed one single time. And a few of the jokes are super cringe-y.The action is alright. I like crazy, outrageous action movies. But none of scenes impressed me. I think part of it is not caring about the characters, which drains the tension. And the fight scenes are once again, for the millionth time, filled with quick-cuts and close-ups so you can\\'t see. When will they learn?I really wish movies would go for the R rating more often. But if you\\'re going to go with PG-13, please stop trying to show (but not show) things that should be in a rated R movie. For example, if someone\\'s throat is slit, don\\'t blatantly cut away at the last second. And then continue to show that person multiple times, with ZERO blood coming out. It makes the movie feel amateur.On four occasions I thought to myself, \"Look, Tom Holland is Spider-Man-ing.\" And it\\'s not because I can\\'t see the actor in any other role. He is very different in Cherry. But things he said sounded exactly like something Peter Parker would say, and things he did looked exactly like Spider-Man would do them. At one point I wondered if they were doing it on purpose. Odd. (1 viewing, opening night IMAX 2/17/2022)',\n",
       " '\"Isn\\'t my house classic? The columns date all the way back to 1972.\"When romantic high-school comedy Clueless (1995) was released, it was immediately vaulted into cult-status and firmly stapled as one of the most original teen-flicks of the 1990s. \\'Original\\' is perhaps a term wrongly applied since it is based on the queen of romance Jane Austen\\'s Emma (1815) . But what Clueless did was update the classic story by coating it with high school drama, teenage girls and shopping and sprinkle it with heavy doses of humour.Emma is no longer Emma; she is Cher (Alicia Silverstone), a spoiled rich girl walking around in her Beverly Hills mansion in a bubble of stereotypes and teen-clichés -- but with a great big heart. So big-hearted, in fact, that she takes on the lost goofy new girl in her school to find her love and popularity, knowing full-well that it could destroy her own reputation. Clueless thus sees Cher and her best friend Dionne (Stacey Dash) on a mission to do good. Real good.All the detours this mission entail are captured brilliantly in the film, taking the form of love-interests, parties, shopping and misunderstandings. From Cher\\'s grumpy lawyer-father (an hilarious Dan Hedaya) and her nerdy step-brother (a likable Paul Rudd) to her eccentric group of friends at school, Clueless is a superb ride of teenage comedy camp. Only just over 10 years old, it is still extremely dated today. But no matter, because the 90s clichés like skateboarding, Marky Mark and the catch-phrase \"As if\" just make it so much more contemporary and fun to watch. What elevates Clueless (1995) above generic high school comedy is its use of stereotypes. In most films they are unintentionally there to create a subconscious effect, but in Clueless they are made fun of to a much higher degree -- they are overblown and glorious. It brutally satirizes rich kids and their \\'problems\\' and juxtaposes them with a classic, heart-felt love-story. The kind that only Jane Austen can write.9/10',\n",
       " 'All throughout the decade of pencil-thin neckties and Pat Benatar look-alikes, various films came along that served to embody the times.  \"Valley Girl\" (which introduced us to Nicholas Cage) and \"Secret Admirer\" were just a drop in the proverbial bucket.  Amy Heckerling\\'s \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" was the textbook definition of life as a teenager in the eighties and remains so to this day.  The story was brought to life in a very unique way that hasn\\'t been duplicated since:There was no actual plot to speak of.  This was just...High School.  It\\'s a film about a group of kids looking for love, status, or a good buzz.  The film was nothing more than that, and it didn\\'t pretend to be more. In addition, Cameron Crowe\\'s script made you *care* about what these kids went through as if their individual situations were happening to us (as they may very well have).  It\\'s almost a crime that a sequel was never made, although a mediocre TV series was spawned.   Armed with a cast of characters that struck a chord with all of us (primarily because we knew someone in High School who acted just like them), and a soundtrack that reeked of the Mark Goodman-J.J. Jackson era of MTV, this film stands as a perfect portrait of a decade a lot of us say we\\'d like to forget....shortly before brushing the dust off an old Night Ranger cassette and indulging in a guilty pleasure.',\n",
       " \"Police Academy (1984) was the first of many films from this series. Since this was the 80's and this film was very successful there was only one alternative, milk the cash cow until it was dry. Like most of these films, the first one is the best and most creative of the bunch. The film follows a bunch of losers and outcasts who join the local police academy for various reasons. The main character is Mahoney (played by Steve Guttenberg) a man with a shady past who enrolls in the academy as an alternative punishment for a previous criminal act. He becomes the motley crew's leader and representative.This movie made Guttenberg a star and it started a film series that would live on D.T.V. and make the producers a lot of money. It also gave people jobs and made others into minor stars. I found this movie to be very entertaining. If you're into juvenile humor and a bunch of cheap laughs, then I recommend this movie. Others need not apply. Followed by six sequels!!Recommended for some laughs and low brow humor. Hey, it's one of the essentials.xxx\",\n",
       " 'This might be a matter of taste, but \"A Bronx Tale\" remains Number 2 on list of Favorite Movies of All Time.  It just happens to be one of the most deeply moving, powerful films I\\'ve ever encountered.  Yes, some may consider this a simple story, but that\\'s the beauty of it.  It\\'s a down-to-earth, coming-of-age story that perfectly mirrors the life of a boy like C growing up in the Bronx at such a hectic time.  Of course, this is based on Chazz Palminteri\\'s real life experiences, and I envy Chazz, being an aspiring screenwriter/director.  I wish I had life experiences like that to put on film.  And I have to commend my man Bobby D for bringing these images to life in such a vibrant, engrossing way.DeNiro captures every element of the 1960\\'s Bronx, with a great opening sequence featuring doo-wop singers sweetly singing the movie\\'s theme.  He captures so many elements of the period, and it was nice to see only one goof was captured.  It was interesting to find out that most of the movie was actually shot in Brooklyn--my hometown.  Then again, the two places are alike in their own simple ways.  Bobby D has a short, but memorable role (which is against type) as a working-class bus driver.  He\\'s desperately trying to get by and support his son, Cologero (I think that\\'s how to spell it...LOL), and disapproves of his son\\'s new \"job\" with gangster Sonny (Chazz, who gives a landmark performance).  The interactions between DeNiro and his son are extraordinary in the way they mirror the way a real father and son would argue in those situations.  As I said, it\\'s the whole down-to-earth quality of this movie that I think made it tick.  It\\'s nothing pretentious.  This is a simple movie about humanity.  The gangster plot is merely a backdrop. \\nThe only other movie I\\'ve seen him in was \"Crimson Tide\" in a very small role, but Lillo Brancato (who plays DeNiro\\'s son in the later years) is a revalation!  He gives one of the best performances I\\'ve ever seen and I\\'m surprised I haven\\'t seen him in any more recent movies.  And I have to say DeNiro did a dynamic job of casting.  As far as I know, Brancato and Bobby aren\\'t related, but please tell me if I\\'m wrong, because they look EXACTLY alike!  If you\\'ve seen any of DeNiro\\'s very early films, Brancato is a mirror image of him.  Is it coincidence or what?  I\\'ve rarely seen a film where the son/daughter even directly resembles the parents, but Brancato has the DeNiro nose and everything.  If you observe closely, there\\'s a scene where Brancato is wearing a black jacket and a black hat, and if you were to see this in a split-screen with DeNiro in \"Mean Streets\" it would be uncanny.  There are so many people I have to commend for this film.  That also includes the supporting cast.  Taral Hicks as C\\'s love interest was also impressive.  And of course, you can\\'t have a movie directed by DeNiro and starring DeNiro without his main amigo making an appearance.  Hopefully, you haven\\'t read the cast list on the IMDB.  Because I was surprised and overjoyed when \"the man\" appeared in the final scene. \\nThere are many lessons on life to be drawn out of this film, some of which given by Chazz\\'s character Sonny, who plays the most likeable gangster I\\'ve seen in cinema.  Yet at the same time, you can\\'t consider him \"too nice.\" Which was a good move.  Sonny was a nice guy in the core, yet he still has a heart of a gangster.  In a great monologue, he explains how he\\'d rather be feared than loved.  And of course there\\'s the great monlogue that everyone remembers:  the car door scene.  That was really an unforgettable speech. Plus, there\\'s funny moments, too.  The gambling scene in the basement, for example.  \"Get in the f**king bathroom!!!\"  LOL...that was hilarious. \\nTo add to the emotional intensity, we have an interracial relationship between Brancato and Hicks at a time when Bronx was heavily segregated and whites wanted absolutely nothing to do with blacks.  The scene where the boys beat those innocent black boys down was an extremely powerful scene. And through DeNiro\\'s direction, we feel the characters\\' every emotion.  I like how he used the doo-wop music to contribute to the soundtrack.By the end, I was almost at tears.  I\\'m virtually tearing up just writing this review and looking at this masterful drama in retrospect.  This is something ONLY Bobby D and Chazz could\\'ve done!  No one could\\'ve done it better!  For me to be this deeply moved by a motion picture is unprecedented.  I wish I could be thanking the two guys in person.If anyone hasn\\'t seen this movie, please don\\'t hesitate to pick it up!  This is one of those great, underrated masterpieces that you feel sad after finding out about its poor success.  A film like this really deserves more recognition.And Bobby D....I think you owe a bunch of \"thank yous\" to your buddy Scorcese.  He\\'s taught you well.My score:  A perfect 10! (out of 10)',\n",

It\\'s the kind of movie that requires optimal concentration, or else you can quickly get lost. In terms of execution, the film is brilliantly accomplished.

It contained every single cliché imaginable, from corny Platoon/Apocalypse Now-type one-liners to ridiculous slow-motion \"sacrifice\" scenes-- all incredibly cheap, contrived and void of any depth what-so-ever.Absolutely NO PLOT-- not a single tangible, well-built contextual plot exists in this movie. John C.

And Samuel L. Jackson?? I think I just might use his appearance in future films as cause to not see them because he is clearly cast for his popularity and for a quick marketing boost for films that clearly need that extra kick. I am going to binge-watch King Kong (2005) with Jack Black until I can forget that I ever saw this new attempted failure to reprise Kong. Have our standards really fallen so far??

I know that seems a bit sad, but this film has so many memorable lines that it came so natural. I\\'ve watched this movie since I was a little girl and the strange thing is that every time I watch it, it just seems to get funnier and funnier. I don\\'t understand how a person could not laugh with this film, it just has perfect humor that I\\'m sure could make the emotionally stunted person laugh. How could you not laugh at Rick Morannis as Lord Helmet? He was beyond a perfect choice for Helmet, he was the complete opposite of what Darth Vadar was, and he didn\\'t have a problem making fun of himself. In fact, the whole cast looked like they had the ultimate blast making this film, everyone clicked so well. The story is one of Mel\\'s finest parades, of course, this one is of Star Wars or pretty much any space film.Lord Helmet and President Skroob wish to steal all of Planet Druidia\\'s fresh air and transfer it onto their own, but they must get the combination to the air shield that is protecting it. King Roland\\'s daughter, Princess Vespa, runs away from her wedding, since King Roland is the king of Druidia, Lord Helmet kidnaps her to get the combination. King Roland asks space rebel, Lone Starr and his faithful side kick Mog(half-man half-dog) Barf, to save the princess. But things quickly turn bad when Helmet does get the combination and now Lone Starr must use the \"schwartz\" and defeat Lord Helmet and Skroob before they suck all the air from Druidia.Spaceballs is seriously just a great comedy, I guarantee you that you will have a good laugh by watching this film. Every scene is just so funny, my favorite is always the one with Lord Helmet playing with his dolls and Corinel Sanders walks in on him, you\\'ll just have to see what I mean, but it\\'s the funniest scene in my opinion. But there isn\\'t one scene that isn\\'t funny. If you are a fan of Mel Brooks, I don\\'t see any reason why you shouldn\\'t love this film, it\\'s my second favorite just behind Young Frankenstein, but that was a tough choice. I highly recommend Spaceballs for anyone, please see this film, you won\\'t regret it.10/10',\n",

Not all teenagers behave like Telly or Casper, but you'd be lying if you said that teenagers don't talk like that. Kids is not exploitation, but rather a brutally honest piece of social commentary. Kids is a deterrent for high risk sexual behavior. The film is also a wake up call for insensitive parents who take no responsibility for their children.

       " \"Ten out of ten. Other viewers can complain all they want about this film being 'tedious' or 'bland', or slightly missing the mark or opportunity, but I strongly disagree. Makes me wonder if they got the true point of the novel, even. Stephen King is NOT a horror writer, so much as he is a writer of characters and extraordinary events that they go through, and most importantly, he writes about the deep emotional experiences that people endure in their lifetimes here on this earth. He tends to throw in dark elements, to be certain, and some of those are downright creepy, frightening, or straight-up horrific; this does not make him a horror writer. And anyone expecting a horror film here will subsequently be disappointed and, I guess, apparently bored. I was not bored, I was riveted the entire time. It's not easy to do what Mike Flanagan does with this adaptation. He nails the mental struggles and fractured psyche of the main character, Jessie, under the strain of what she faces. He also delivers on the heart of King's story, which isn't the present situation she finds herself in as an adult, but rather, dealing with secrets and ghosts from her past that have haunted her all her life, without her truly even knowing 'til her current situation arises. It's a beautiful novel of pain, suffering, secrets, abuse (on multiple levels, by multiple people), and the struggle to not just survive, but also heal and thrive, if possible. Flanagan's film captures the heart of King's story, and it is beautifully rendered, and many scenes are equally visually stunning. I cried at the end of the movie. Bruce Greenwood and Carla Gugino turn in excellent performances, among the best I've seen from both of them. Henry Thomas is equally and fittingly gross. Very well done. Even younger Jessie, played by Chiara Aurelia, was exacted with nuanced grace and heartbreak. This is just a terrific movie. And I find every scene featuring Carel Struycken to be extremely creepy, so I'm not certain how other reviewers find this movie lacking in creep value. I just can't disagree more. I love this movie, it's instantly and already in my top fifteen, maybe even my top ten favorite films of all time. Well done. I'll be watching this one more than once.\",\n",
       " 'This is one of my favorite films, even though it has some problems.The film caused controversy with some of the gay crowd (who didn\\'t like the negative press) and for the graphic sex (with bedroom violence). It became a box office winner, that made Sharon Stone a star, and yet was basically p****d on by the critics! The word is the film is better than your average B movie skin flick, only by the quality of the actors, and Verhoeven\\'s ability. I feel the film is still not given the respect it\\'s  due. I first saw the R-rated version, which is very good, but now you can get the even better Unrated Director\\'s Cut, which has even more graphic content! If you don\\'t like erotic-thrillers, then don\\'t see it. But anyone with taste will enjoy the thrill ride of events that take place in Basic Instinct. The script by Joe Eszterhas was highly thought of in Hollywood, and if not for the graphic nudity, a top star like Michelle Pfeiffer would have taken the role made famous by Sharon stone.Does the script go too far at times? Yes, but that\\'s part of the films charm, and after all, the now \\'classic film moment\\' of Sharon Stone\\'s leg spread interrogation, likely would have been dropped in a conventional film. Still though, I wouldn\\'t have minded seeing a few less people getting killed off, to keep even more suspense and realism. The score is also beautiful, and fans of Hitchcock\\'s great \"Vertigo\" can appreciate the homage that Paul Verhoeven has included. The film has a lot of eye candy, but Jeanne Tripplehorn deserves special mention for her impressive supporting role (sadly she hasn\\'t done much of note since). Michael Douglas does a solid job also, but I can\\'t help wondering if a better actor like Clint Eastwood could have brought more to the table. The dialogue is not up to the level of \"Pulp Fiction\", but it\\'s still interesting and fun. I highly recommend this film for fans of adult mystery.',\n",
       " \"Just like the mud and the dust on the characters in the film, the excellent The Rover gets under the skin and remains there, long after the screen went black.The story takes place in the Australian outback in the near future after a collapse. A bitter loner sees his car stolen by a gang and tries to get it back at all cost with the help of the wounded, simple brother of a gang member, left behind after a disastrous robbery.Slow and intense The Rover sucks you into the desert, you can almost feel the heat and the flies in your face. Few words are used, more is said by gunshots. Here are no action heroes who at the end clean up the mess, restore the order and peace and let you leave theater with the feeling that you were nicely entertained. The people in The Rover are desperate to such extent that they've almost become indifferent towards life. They try to survive, period.The bizarre relationship between the angry loner Eric and the naive, dependent Rey is wonderfully brought on screen. Both Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson deliver brilliant performances. Guy embodies perfectly the bitter,rude, inner wounded Eric with his body language and the intense gaze . Robert disappears into Rey, a damaged rather innocent soul who IMO has been taught to blindly obey and not to think for himself, in a way that will blow people away. The tics and blinks belong to Rey, you see them disappear when he feels more at ease, reappear in situations of stress. The supporting actors are amazing as well.Although the film is dark, the mood is not cold IMO. Under the surface of alienation and cruelty there's a palpable emotional layer of vulnerability and fear. Michôd created a world frighteningly realistic and raw, a world we, civilized people, in fact don't want to face. With his second movie David shows again how incredibly talented he is. I was eagerly anticipating The Rover and it met all my expectations. The performances alone is pure enjoyment together with the beautiful landscapes and the amazing music score. Some scenes are quite funny like Rey trying to do his best to be a good partner, or when he's singing.There's also a lot to think about after watching The Rover. What collapse can cause such situation? How far are civilized people willing to go when there's nothing left to loose? Is Rey mentally disabled or is he the product of a very unfavorable education?And why did I think about Animal Kingdom after The Rover had finished? See the movie and you'll know. Sorry for mistakes, English isn't my native language.\",\n",
       " \"Malena is a beautiful and deeply touching film. It is a masterful combination of sites, sounds and colors. The two leading actors (Monica Bellucci and Giuseppe Sulfaro) are simply excellent at what they are supposed to convey in this movie. Apart from her truly majestic elegance, Monica Bellucci invests her character (Malena) with an aura of tragedy, of some profound and unrelenting emotional trauma and pain which remains unspoken throughout the film and reaches its climax at the very end. Malena's stunningly beautiful eyes remain constantly downcast, and her face -- tense and pierced through by psychic pain (she rarely raises her face, let alone speaks words). Renato (the teenage boy) wins his audience by his incredibly pure and valiant love for Malena (this affection he carries in his heart for several years). She becomes his muse, his courage, his sense of honor, his whole rationale for confronting difficult and disruptive life of the war-torn Italy. I agree completely with another commentator who said that the ending of the movie is perhaps one of the most genuinely melancholic moments in modern cinematography. Simply brilliant. Superb music! This movie should be watched several times to be fully appreciated.\",\n",
       " 'When I saw the posters hanging around town for the upcoming Disney animated movie \"Encanto\", I must admit that I was definitely interested in watching it. Sure, I didn\\'t even know what it was about, but I liked the posters, and let\\'s just face it, Disney does usually pump out pretty good animated movies.So as I had the chance to sit down and watch what directors Jared Bush, Byron Howard and Charise Castro Smith had to offer with the 2021 animated movie \"Encanto\", of course I did so. And thus I sat down to watch it now with my 11 year old son.At least he thoroughly enjoyed it. Me, on the other hand, not so much. I found the storyline to be somewhat bland and tame. There wasn\\'t much appeal to the storyline told in \"Encanto\" for me, so it wasn\\'t the best of Disney animated movies by a long shot. Hold on, don\\'t get me wrong here, because I am not saying that \"Encanto\" wasn\\'t watchable or bad or anything, no, no, not at all. It was just, well, bland.Visually, now this is where \"Encanto\" was hitting a home run. I have to admit that the visual effects, the graphics and CGI, the colors, the art style, and all was just spectacular. And that alone was actually making it well-worth sitting through a viewing of \"Encanto\". I have to tip my hat in admiration of the animators and artists here, because they definitely worked the Disney magic.I have to admit that I was not familiar with the vast majority of the voice talents that brought the characters to life in \"Encanto\", aside from John Leguizamo and Wilmer Valderrama. But I will say that Disney definitely had managed to get a great ensemble of talented voice actors and actresses for \"Encanto\".With \"Encanto\" being an animated Disney movie, of course you will be in for numerous musical segments throughout the course of the story. However, I didn\\'t really find any of the songs in \"Encanto\" to be particularly catchy. Perhaps they need to be heard a couple of times in order to stand out. So on that account, then \"Encanto\" was lacking that Disney magic.If you enjoy Disney animated movies, then by all means give \"Encanto\" a chance. It is incredibly beautiful, and perhaps you will fall in love with the storyline and the characters, just because I didn\\'t doesn\\'t mean that you won\\'t.Ultimately, then I was somewhat disappointed with \"Encanto\", which also reflects my mediocre rating of five stars for this 2021 animated movie. \"Encanto\" definitely didn\\'t spur the need for more than a single viewing on my behalf.',\n",
       " \"If you haven't seen Casino yet, stop whatever it is you're doing, rush to the nearest video store, rent it, and watch it.  Along with Mean Streets Casino is probably Scorsese's most underrated and unheralded picture.  I would also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film. The film deals with a particular time period and a particular atmosphere and accomplishes an overwhelming achievement by creating and accurately portraying both.  The art direction is splendid, most likely the best of any film Scorsese has ever done.  The acting is superb.  I never thought Pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in Raging Bull until I saw Casino.  Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again.  This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in.  Scorsese's direction is flawless. Perhaps it is because I watch alot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just don't seem to hold.  Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker.  Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career.  Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it.  This film is truly a gem.\",\n",

You could say the same about the violence. It's brutal. I love that they take full advantage of the R-rating. It doesn't hold back. I liked all of the kill scenes and carnage.So why didn't I like this more? I have no idea. I was having a decent time. But I wasn't fully engaged or attached. My mind wandered a couple times.

       " \"In late 1973 and early 1974, women and men were lined up for blocks. People were known to become ill watching it. Some fainted. Some ran out of the theater in tears. There were reports of people having to be institutionalized, and at least one miscarriage was attributed to viewing it. No, it wasn't a Rolling Stones Concert. It was a film called The Exorcist.The first time I had heard of something called The Exorcist was on late night television when the author, William Peter Blatty, was a guest on The Tonight Show. The conversation centered around how horrible some of the things in the book were. I had also seen the novel listed on The New York Times Bestseller List, and it seemed as if it would remain there forever. After having been on the waiting list for what seemed like an eternity at the local library, I was finally able to obtain a copy. It was the first book I had read in one sitting since probably Nancy Drew and The Hidden Staircase quite a few years earlier. And yes, for it's time it was filled with gut wrenching details of what happens when for some unexplained reason; an innocent girl is possessed by Satan. While reading the book I was sure that if it ever made its way to film, most of the details would certainly be either `cleaned up' or omitted altogether. As you know the film was made and it spared the movie going public absolutely nothing in the way of details.Certainly many of the people who lined up to see The Exorcist did so to watch some of the more gruesome scenes, the worst of which involved Regan's masturbation with a crucifix. Yet, the hysteria went well beyond the fact that such scenes were so vividly depicted. I think one needs to look no further than Mel Gibson's The Passion to find the answer as to why. I'm sure most of you have read the story of people leaving Mel's film in tears, some to the point of being hysterical. From most articles I have read, it seems that the majority of the audience that was moved were those people of strong religious beliefs. For many others, the depiction of the brutality in The Passion may have been uncomfortable to sit through, but weren't emotionally effected to any degree. Much of this same feeling can explain the hysteria surrounding The Exorcist. Those who had a definitive belief in Heaven and Hell, of Good and Evil, of Jesus as The Savior and Satan as the epitome of pure evil were affected by The Exorcist far more than those who were agnostic or just never had a strong belief in spiritual matters. There is no doubt though that much in the way The Passion did, The Exorcist caused many to reconsider how they felt about their faith. The Exorcist made the prospect of Satan being alive and well and a life of eternal damnation a very uncomfortable prospect. The fact that Blatty claims his book and screenplay were based on a true story seemed to give the film even more credibility.For me, The Exorcist has always been more about the never ending conflict between pure evil and pure innocence than about being an average horror story. There are many more levels to this film than what initially meets the eye. There is no doubt that while the main story revolves around an innocent young girl, Regan McNeil (Linda Blair), being inhabited by Satan himself, Blatty enhances it greatly by adding different characters in various stages of conflict. Regan's mother, Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) obviously cares deeply for her daughter. Yet she is not beyond reproach. In one scene when Reagan's father hasn't called on Regan's birthday, we see her desperately on the phone doing battle with an overseas operator. The problem is not how vicious the phone call is, but that she does it within ear shot of her daughter as if to drive the point home to Regan how worthless her father is. When, she finally does seek the aid of Father Damian Karras, we don't feel that she believes in exorcism anymore than he does, but is desperate enough to accept the fact that it is possible and will take any and all measures to save her daughter.Father Karras (Jason Miller) is a priest torn by conflict. He is ridden by overwhelming guilt for having abandoned his mother to enter the priesthood. He is torn spiritually by the confessions of those priests who seek his help as a psychiatrist, so much so that he now questions his own faith. When he states to the Bishop that `Regan's case meets all the criteria,' we know that even more than Chris, he doesn't really believe in the power of Satan to inhabit a living being in the manner that it has taken over Regan. Yet, he will do what is required of him as a priest concerned about the health of a child.Jack McGowran gives a terrific performance as the alcoholic director filming Chris's latest film in Georgetown. Kitty Winn is Sharon Spencer, the secretary who works for Chris and always seems to be in the line of fire when Chris is angry. She is always there but for all the horror she witnesses, Winn appears too bland and emotionless and her performance is probably the weakest in the film.Max Von Sydow as Father Lancester Merrin is a no nonsense aging priest. He has done battle with evil before and he shows us its effect in every scene he occupies. One could pass it off to being just good make-up but it is so much more than that as Sydow demonstrates all the nuances that brings to life a man who has faced Satan and lived to tell about it. He knows what he is up against, understands he must do it again and the consequences of what that battle may be.If I have a small complaint with The Exorcist it is in regards to the character of Lt. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb). I have never been able to buy into the character. It is not the fault of Cobb who is his usual stalwart self in the role. The whole character should at best have only been necessary for a few brief scenes yet; he has several that go on way too long and do not add anything to the story. Even in his scenes with Chris or Damian, Kinderman is so odd that he distracts us too much from their characters and it is Chris and Damian's reactions that are more important to us, not his investigation. For all you trivia buffs out there, Blatty once sued the producers of Columbo, stating they based Peter Falk's character on Kinderman. If memory serves me correctly Blatty lost that one.As for Director William Friedken, although he won the best director award for The French Connection, for me The Exorcist will always remain his defining film. The Final half hour of The Exorcist are still as dynamic today as they were 31 years ago, French Connection car chase be damned.It seems that to many of the younger movie audiences of today, The Exorcist has become more of a joke than anything else. That's not surprising considering how many times it has been lampooned, even by Linda Blair herself in Repossessed. Yet, if they were to view the film in a more serious vein, not as just another creature feature, they may just find that there really is more to this film than a little girl spewing pea soup and spinning her head around 360 degrees. It is the ultimate battle between Heaven and Hell and Good and Evil. It is the story of the complete and total degradation of innocence. It is a study in character, and whether a man torn by the forces surrounding him, can regain his faith and his belief in God and mankind to save the life of a little girl, caught up in forces beyond her control.Call it a horror film, call it a religious film, call it what you want. For me, The Exorcist is and will always remain a classic in every sense of the word. And if I regard you as a classic of any kind I have no choice but to leave you with my grade, which for The Exorcist is an A.\",\n",

       " 'It is a hot sunny day in South America. We see a bunch of men, shot mostly from the back. They are walking deep into the forest. We see a tall dark figure. He is wearing an old leather jacket, he has the 5 o\\'clock shadow looking like it\\'s closer to midnight, he wears a fedora and he carries a bull-whip ( yes a bull-whip ). Finally, two of the men enter a cave and we hear about some guy named Forstall, who was good, very, very good, but he never came out of the place alive. But they enter anyway. They are confronted with tarantulas, spears that are triggered by blocking out the light, a pit that they must swing over and then more tiny poisonous darts that come out of the wall. All this to protect an ancient gold statue. They recover it. One guy dies and the other barely makes it out of the room before it all falls on him. Then he has to get out of the cave and a giant boulder chases him. Finally he makes it out of the cave only to be surrounded by Hovitos and his arch enemy named Belloq. He takes the gold statue that this guy worked so hard for and then the guy runs and makes it to the plane where he is in the passenger seat and there is big snake in the plane. He hates snakes. This mans name? Indiana Jones!Whhhoooooo!! I\\'m left breathless just describing that opening. But is there a better beginning of a movie ever? Absolutely not. Does the beginning have anything to do with the rest of the film. No. It is all decoration for what the movie is going to put you through in the 90 minutes to come.Indiana Jones is the best character to ever hit the screens. And he better be. He is created by George, Steven and played by Harrison Ford. That may seem normal now that we have lived with him for 20 years, but can you imagine what that must have been like back in 1981. That would be like Tom Hanks or Will Smith joining forces with James Cameron and Steven Spielberg for a completely original idea in today\\'s terms.Raiders took a simple idea and maybe an idea that the guys had from watching Saturday afternoon movies and made it larger than life. This film never stops for you to take your breath. It is filled with rich characters from Indy himself to Marion to Belloq and even to Marcus Brody. Each has their own personality that shines through in certain scenes. Some of my faves were when we first meet Marion having a shot contest in her bar in Nepal. Then there is her scene with Belloq and they get drunk together and she tries to leave using only a butter knife. And of course who can forget Indy\\'s battle with the swordsman and his unrivaled determination to get the ark. \" Indy, there is not time. If you still want the truck it is being loaded on a truck for Cairo. \" ( a battered and bloody Indy ) \" Truck? What truck?\" ( and then later ) \"Get some transport back to England, boat, plane, anything. Meet me at Omar\\'s. I\\'m going after that truck. \"Sola ) \" How? \" ( Indy ) I don\\'t know I\\'m making this up as I go.\"Raiders has more energy than three action films. And that is what makes it the classic that it is. If you like movies, then Raiders is a movie that will not let you down. It is pure entertainment and that is indisputable. It finds the youngster in all of us and bombards us with this silly, whip-cracking, average, incredibly determined archaeologist and only asks us to have fun. And that we do. And to me, the only reason that Chariots of Fire won best picture that year is because it is a serious film. Raiders was heads and shoulders above Chariots and it should have cleaned up at the Oscars in 81. But more politics with the academy.Raiders of the Lost Ark is the epitome of entertainment. What more can be said about it. If you haven\\'t seen this movie in a while or if you haven\\'t seen it at all ( gasp ) then do yourself a favour and rent it tonight. It is awesome.TRUST ME',\n",
       " \"I was lucky enough to be able to watch the movie one week early, since it opened here in Brazil one week before the release in the US, and I must tell you this fellow The Hunger Games fans, even though my English is not even that good: Catching Fire is a GREAT experience, and one that improves over the first film in nearly every possible level.When I first read the books, I thought that they were not only incredibly addicting and fun, but also with an important message for the youngsters (and every other person, age is not important) who read it, and that made it different from some of the other uninteresting YA books around. I really liked the trilogy, and when I watched the first adaptation, I was disappointed with some aspects and routes they went with it. It was not an horrible movie, at all, but it was not very faithful to the book and lacked the impact I found in the novel.With that in mind, I kept my excitement in close watch with Catching Fire and went expecting a good movie and nothing more. I was welcomed with an excellent surprise: the movie followed the events of the novel whenever possible and brilliantly so, while managing to keep me on the edge of my seat, even though I knew what was going to happen the entire time.I won't go into details about the plot of the movie, some fellow reviewers already did it probably better than I'll ever do and the chances you're familiar with it are high. So I'll go right into the review and my opinions on the picture.Francis Lawrence was nothing short of an excellent choice for the director's chair: gone are the shaky camera action (one of my major problems with the first film) and welcome are thrilling and pumping action scenes that expertly convey the tension and ferocity of the moment. He managed to keep the violence and shock without ever crossing the line, and whoever read the books know how important this is; it's part of the plot, of the criticism and one of the main elements that make the whole point of the film. He keeps you interested and invested in the story even when nothing bombastic is happening, and that is a great achievement, something that really sets this sequel apart.But Francis is not alone on making this movie special. His young and talented cast, lead by the always amazing Jennifer Lawrence, is ferocious and eager to invest in their characters, making you an ally (or an enemy) while watching everything unfold. Lawrence shows us again why she was the perfect choice to play the now iconic Katniss Everdeen: she makes you root for this young, brave lady every single minute of the struggle; with her sad, hopeless stare that pierces your soul to her ability to convey admirable strength when everything seems to be out of reach are phenomenal and she deserves the praise she gets.The rest of the cast is uniformly good, but I have to highlight Jena Malone, who plays the explosive Johanna: her presence makes the screen on fire whenever she's in, mixing the perfect amount of attitude and humor. A particular scene involving an elevator and a fancy dress is at the same time hilarious and shocking, just like her character. Donald Sutherland also shines as the menacing president Snow, in a restrained performance that doesn't need too many words spoken to make you think twice on how dangerous he is.The set pieces are also vastly improved upon: bigger, more ambitious and work perfectly in sync with the action to make for some really unforgettable moments. The arena looks beautiful and foreboding, hiding it's dangers behind the shining green water. So does the bizarre Capitol and the Districts, full of sadness and fear, two dichotomies in every aspect.But what I really liked about the movie was that they didn't shy away from the political aspects from the novel and conveyed the despair and oppression imposed by the Capitol over the rest of Panem. It makes you think that all of this is happening around the world, in one way or another, maybe masquerade, but it is. It's sad that many teenagers are only in this ride for the hot action and beautiful people (some screaming girls in the movie theater I went only confirm this. They were not the majority, it was packed and most people were also extremely annoyed by it too - every time Finnick appeared it was a screaming hell). It has so much more to offer.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire not only improves vastly upon it's predecessor: it's a great cinematic experience by itself, touching on important topics about the modern day society without losing it's thrilling core. It's not perfect, but what it does right it goes right into the bullseye. Don't let the hype or the teen fury on this fool you: it is entertainment at it's best.\",\n",
       " 'First things first, A Simple Favour is not really a mystery film, well not a good one at least. As much as the marketing would have you believe, those looking for the next Gone Girl or The Girl on The Train will need to continue their search. The story here is far-fetched, overcooked and unravels in such a haste that it\\'s hard to treat much of it seriously. Director Paul Feig (best known for his comedy works such as Bridesmaids and Spy), seemingly aware of the story\\'s inherent ridiculousness, keeps the film light and easily digestible, but the result is a weird tonal hybrid of a comedy-mystery that fails at being either. Think Game Night, but more obnoxious than funny.Based on the novel by Darcey Bell, A Simple Favour follows Stephanie (Anna Kendrick), a widowed, single mum who runs a mommy blog. Her goody two-shoes personality makes her pariah amongst the other parents. One day, on a playdate for their children, she befriends Emily (Blake Lively), a chic, elegant woman whose everything she is not. Before long they become best friends, and when Emily disappears, Stephanie steps out of her shell to solve the mystery.Anna Kendrick stars in a role perfectly attuned to her goofy charms and Blake Lively convincingly embodies the enigmatic nature of her character in a crucial supporting role. Henry Golding, hot off Crazy Rich Asians, gets the rough end of the deal playing Emily\\'s husband, a character who, while not entirely likeable, is cruelly used and manipulated by the two female protagonists throughout the film. It\\'s disheartening to see that the film\\'s message of female empowerment often comes as a result of emasculating its primary male character. In fact, the film\\'s regressive approach to bolstering its two strong female leads does the film a great disservice.The only consistency between all the characters is that none of them are particularly likeable. They each make questionable decisions, are gratingly self-centered and become increasingly obnoxious as the film progresses with its dubious twists. By the end, you\\'ll be hard pressed to care about any of them. This is no more evident than in the film\\'s tacked on \"where are they now?\\' postscript that feels completely unnecessary and ill informed in assuming audiences care enough about the characters to know where they end up. On the upside, Feig, who is more proficient in making fun films rather than serious ones, keeps the film feeling light and easy-going. He knowingly teases the audience with a stylish soundtrack filled with classy French music, and there are some funny scenes that incite light chuckles rather than any laugh out loud bursts of humour. These meager positives don\\'t improve the stillborn narrative but at least they make it a little less painful to digest.Ultimately, A Simple Favour is a strange blend of mystery and comedy that doesn\\'t gel into a cohesive whole. As a piece of entertainment, it\\'s entirely disposable. As a thriller, well, imagine Gone Girl as directed by Paul Feig. Or better yet, don\\'t.',\n",

Jimmy Jean-Louis makes an appearance in the second half and carries the movie, helping our protoganists reach the road to freedom.The only reason why I didn't give this movie 10 stars is Prithvi's excessive romantic angle with Amala. I felt the song shot in the pond was unnecessary and didn't add any value to the movie.Judging by the positive reaction of the audience, I'm confident this movie will do better than Manjummel Boys. Well done, Prithvi and Blessy!\",\n",
       " \"It's as if John Wick is the savant janitor from Good Will Hunting, and surprisingly, it worked.What should you expect? It has flashes of John Wick action, but it most certainly isn't an all out action movie, however, it also isn't primarily a drama focusing on his autistic/accounting side of things; I felt they did a really good job of combining both elements into a movie that swings back and forth between the two.I thought the acting was great all around; I found the plot solid and enjoyable. Here is the bottom line: Yes, this movie is worth your money to see in the theater. p.s. I'll be the first to admit I have no idea how autism really affects people and how accurate it is or is not portrayed in this movie; I saw this movie as nothing more than what it is: a fictional story to entertain.\",\n",
       " \"I am only writing this review so I can remember later on why I only gave this movie a 6. I understand that this movie has an extremely powerful and intimate presentation of the relationship between a reckless father and his young daughter. I noticed the intricacies and nuance that the film makers tried to convey throughout. I just did not connect with the film at all. I imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me I was quite bored with it by the end. I have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me, it is simply ok. Don't take my rating too seriously because I can genuinely imagine somebody else watching this film thinking that it is the best thing they ever saw.\",\n",
       " 'I don\\'t really know what it is about Dirty Dancing.. there is some sort of absolute magic in this movie.. I cannot possibly recount the hundreds (yes, hundreds)of times I\\'ve watched it, beginning to end... but every time I do come upon it on TV, I am entranced and mystified and sit myself down and there I am, for two hours, loving the movie as if I\\'m watching it for the first time. Although Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey absolutely hated each other throughout the making of this film, they possess a beautiful chemistry on the set.. it makes the viewer enjoy it that much more, to see this passion and commitment.. and I can\\'t help tearing up a tiny bit at the end, when Patrick comes up to the Houseman family and tells her dad, \"Nobody puts Baby in a corner\". (classic moment) For all those people who believe this movie is corny and sappy, maybe in a way it is, but it was the penicle of the 80\\'s films, and put Patrick Swayze right on the map; his performance was immaculate. Three Cheers for Dirty Dancing !!Ps- The soundtrack is fantastic, an absolute masterpiece',\n",
       " 'Reservoir Dogs is a testament to the idea that \"less is more.\" This doesn\\'t apply to the violence, the film is extremely violent from beginning to end, but the details of the botched diamond heist, which the entire film is based on, are conveyed only in the dialogue, except for one scene where Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) recalls his escape. The whole film takes place after the failed robbery is over, and the mystery that unfolds among the criminal participants is amazing to watch. This is not a normal crime film. The thing that really sets Reservoir Dogs apart from all of the others is that it is PURE. When you look at the screen, you\\'re looking at reality. There are no Hollywood actors, there\\'s no make-up to make them look pretty, there\\'s little to no comic relief, and most important of all, there\\'s no goofy romantic subplot clumsily thrown in, a detrimental trademark of so many action films, as well as  virtually all Jerry Bruckheimer films. Instead of all of that garbage, Tarantino decided to just present the film as simply and straightforwardly as possible, and by doing that he makes it seem that you\\'re really looking at a bunch of criminals trying to figure out what to do after a suspiciously failed robbery. Even though most of the actors were known at the time this film was made, the film was delivered in such a way that you don\\'t see the actors at all, you only see the brutal characters that they portray. It is genuinely frightening to imagine being in the same room with any of them, and this is a quality that is rarely achieved in any kind of film.\\nMake no mistake, Reservoir Dogs is among the most violent films ever made, and some scenes are really painful to watch, but the way that reality is captured is something that justifies the violent excesses in this film. The violence is never glorified, nor is the criminal lifestyle. When films are overly violent, they usually get branded as such, but despite the extreme violence, Reservoir Dogs still manages to deliver an important overall message about the consequences of your actions. It remains high on the growing list of Tarantino\\'s classic films, and it will not be soon forgotten.',\n",
       " \"It was fine, but I don't understand why America always have to make a remake of a perfectly good already existing film or series!It didn't do the book justice as the original movie and I usually love Tom hanks.They should have left it alone, or is it too hard for them to read subtitles? ( they remake English shows like ghost as well too so that really doesn't make sense, in a bad way too)The film is Perfectly fine if you haven't watched the original or read the book, it'sa heartwarming story with a bit of drama and comedy.Tom hanks is a brilliant actor and the support cast is good too!\",\n",
       " 'A lot has been said about this movie, as is the case with many recent Hollywood comics adaptations. While I truly respect everyone\\'s opinion, I really don\\'t see the point in some criticisms brought up against this movie.(Definitely NO spoilers ahead.)First of all, we must realize that X-men comics have been around for decades. They existed before many of you were born. Still, the producers had to assume that the average audience had little or no idea about the mutant phenomenon, but Bryan singer did a very good job (as always) in the first film, and introduced the audience. Besides, adapting such a story with so many characters to the screen is no easy job, and is also risky, considering it\\'s Hollywood and it must return all those millions. So the mutant phenomenon was well explained, the characters and their abilities introduced, and the plot (which actually had a story, unlike many action flicks) was carried out smoothly. All in the running time of one film. good job.The second film, however, had to concentrate (naturally) on more characters and a more thorough story. This is why I object (in the title) to people criticising this film for \"lack of character development\" etc. Many of the characters WERE developed in the first film. If you never read x-men comics, and did not even see the first movie, and see this one right away and still expect the director/writer to spell things out for you, well, you\\'ll be disappointed. \"Where did Colossus take the kids during the attack?\" someone asked. To hide them somewhere, THAT\\'S where he took them. I don\\'t think people would like to see the director spell out everything, such as Colossus\\' inner voice saying, \"Well, let me take these kids somewhere beneath this multimillion dollar facility, to hide them from the bad guys.\"And the newly-introduced characters were introduced well enough. You see their abilities, you see whose side they\\'re on, you even learn more about their personalities as the movie progresses. What else do you need to learn? Which team he supports?The highlight of the film was definitely Mystique\\'s transformation scenes, very well done.The movie had many shortcomings, of course, the pace slowed down more than once, some main characters, especially Cyclops, were almost lost, but the plusses were way more than minuses. Especially Nightcrawler, who almost stole the lead from Wolverine. I must also add that Wolverine is much more violent in this film than the first, much more like the original comic character.As for the people who complain about the abundance of characters. Well, bad news for you. X-men is not a story of a couple of guys and their girlfriends. There are much more characters, hopefully to be seen in the next sequel(s). Jubilee, Pyro and Colossus were all hinted in this one. Though I\\'m eager to see Gambit also, I can\\'t wait to see how they will do the Beast. Of course, I can see the \"no character development\" people asking each other, \"Who is Beast?\"In short, this movie does what it\\'s supposed to do: Gives us entertainment, and shows us our favorite characters on screen.',\n",
       " \"Rather than grow the story, they just went in a straight line and rehashed the same story on a slightly bigger scale. The film makers ignore the fact that the aliens are intelligent and organized enough for interstellar travel, but appear to have no organization, no agenda, and very little intelligence now that they have reached earth. They just seem to be wandering killing machines. I'm not even sure if they feed on people. I didn't see that in this film and I can't remember if they did in the first. So do they just walk around and listen for things to kill? What are they going to do once everyone is dead? Also, they can't swim, but chose to land on a planet that is 75% water? Maybe they should have prepared better.Makes me think they are soldiers for a superior race of beings that we have not seen yet. Maybe in the next film. I'm not holding my breath.\",\n",
       " \"Short review: I've always loved the concept of one small decision changing everything in a massive way. We were actually warned by the director before watching this film not to watch it. I thought to myself, I've seen the worst of the worst, how bad could it be? This isn't a film like 'A Serbian Film' or 'Hostel' that sets out with no purpose other than to shock you as much as possible. But this film will drain you and have you thinking long after the credits roll.There are a couple of moments of humour in the film, and they are genuinely funny moments, but because of the subject and tone of the film you feel like a monster if you laugh. I can't remember experiencing that before.This is an emotionally draining film and not one that is designed for everyone to watch. However if you are game I think you will find it both rewarding and memorable. 8/10.\",\n",
       " \"This is the best film I have seen all year, and I saw just about every good film to hit theaters in 2013. I think it's because it is so representational of what it's like to be human.There are so many things that make this movie special, but I'll just mention a few. 1. The score is INCREDIBLE. The music paired with the beautiful sound design make you FEEL the movie. Sure, you see everything on the screen, which is already beautiful, but then that music hits you and the emotions just start to run. I laughed, I cried, my brain got all tingly. It was an emotional roller coaster, and the score assisted in that so well. 2. The script. I knew how this movie was going to end 30 minutes in. And unlike most who would then say that it's predictable and not worth watching, I consider that awesome, because it means that the script is tight enough to tell a good story with a believable arc. Every scene in this movie is straight up powerful! Like it will fill your heart with sadness and happiness and pain and guilt and confusion. And then rinse and repeat. For 2 hours. It moves through all of the most complex and interesting questions that we should be asking ourselves about what it means to be a human being. About what it means to be alive. This film is about all that life is. And after the screening, as well as during, I found myself questioning things in my own life that either don't make sense or don't have to make sense. Like love and thoughts and emotions. They're all so natural and yet none of us truly understand how they work. In my opinion, moreso than any other film this year, Her has the perfect mix of complex ideas, story, and character development. One of the best scripts ever written. 3. Cinematography. My personal favorite shot to see and use is the extreme close up. And that shot was all over this movie. The reason I love it so much and believe it works so well is because it allows you to see the emotions of the character so plainly. Like their face is right in your face, so you just have to look at it. And that's where Joaquin shines. He delivers such a powerful and emotional performance and the close ups are there to capture it all. They also make great use of the natural backlighting of Shanghai, and the colors all fuse to make it a really pretty movie. I'd say the cinematography is on par with Drive and/or Lost in Translation in terms of the style. It looks like every shot was photographed with the intent to make it the most beautiful shot in the film. And I admire the DP's work. He did a really great job. More than anything though, this film just made me feel. Everything about it was so beautiful. I didn't want it to end. I felt like the film was controlling me - playing with my mind as if it were a joystick. And that's just something you don't get every day. Very rarely am I awe- stricken by a movie, and this film made my jaw drop. It is without a doubt the best film of the year, and upon just one viewing, one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time.\",\n",
       " \"Just as some movies that should be great turn out to be awful, some movies that should be awful turn out to be great - Masters of the Universe. Unfortunately, for a film that's based on a cartoon that today's 20-somethings used to watch in the 1980's, none of the said 20-somethings are going to admit to liking it now. Few will give it a chance and realize the direction is good, the acting is good, the music is good, that it's exciting, funny, scary, suitably epic and absolutely action-packed and that it looks fantastic. But Superhero Cinema does. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe was a hugely successful mid-80's cartoon based on a line of action figures. The success of each fed the other, as well as a popular comicbook and loads of other merchandise. Finally in 1987 came the big one: the motion picture.What looks like suicide at first glance - converting a cartoon based on action figures into a full-length feature - gets more appealing when you look at thes ource material closer. The cartoon is a epic hybrid of fantasy and sci-fi, with ancient castles and sorcerers mixing with laser guns and cyborgs. It also has a very mythic feel, mixing Ancient Greece-era monsters and challenges with fairy tale locations.There are also hordes of exotic characters - warriors, mutants, monsters, magicians of every description, so the film makers could pick the coolest ones to bring to the screen. The ones they've chosen are He-Man and his arch enemy Skeletor (obviously), amazon-type female warrior Teela and her dad Man-At -Arms, the Sorceress of Grayskull, Skeletor's second in command Evil Lyn (which is always pronounced 'Evil-In'), and Beastman. Added to these are four characters that were created for the film - Gwildor, a dwarf-like inventor, Karg, a cross between Captain Hook and a bat, snake-like Sauron, and Blade, a sword and knife-obsessed slaphead. So that's eleven fantasy characters running about, which is a pretty good total.\\nMasters of the Universe succeeds because it takes the cartoon and adapts not it's superficial qualities, but it's essence into a movie, turning it into a mature sci-fi/fantasy adventure. This is where so many comic and cartoon based movies fail. They don't adapt their source material properly to make a successful feature film. You need to make the movie a natural progression from what it's based on, altering the look enough so it looks acceptable in real action, altering the characters into real people, choosing actors who can give real performances. It's not simply dressing superstars up as characters from a comic or cartoon, it's re-imagining the ideas as a movie. MotU does this perfectly. You can fault it as a film itself, of course, but you can't fault it as an adaption.The production design is superb, with some superbly realized sets and costumes. Everything has been adapted to look more realistic on the big screen. The cast give uniformly decent performances. Nobody lets the side down - these are all 3D characters, not cartoons. Dolph Lungren proves he's one of the European bodybuilder brigade who can act. Frank Langella gives an outstanding performance as Skeletor, his powerful presence almost bursting out of the TV and into your living room. Langella gives a shining example to all actors portraying comicbook and cartoon characters in live action. There is a pervading sense of dread whenever he appears, especially during Castle Grayskull sequences, and the script gives him some awesome lines which he delivers with pure evil dripping from his voice.The monsters are pretty bloody scary, especially for a family film, especially the Beastman (who's had a 'the' added to his name). The sequence where they invade a school gym and chase Julie around it is excellent, far more exciting and scary than similar chases in many horror films (including some of those Courtney Cox has been in). It's also, like the rest of the film, surprisingly violent, as the bad guys attack Julie with swords, claws, laser guns and high velocity darts. That she manages to escape is not unbelievable at all, because of the way the chase is staged - it's just a relief she gets out of there, the goal of any such chase scene. The sheer ammount of bad guys that the small band of heroes has to face adds greatly to the drama.Setting half of the movie on Earth has it's advantages and disadvantages. It does give the film a human component, and two ordinary teenagers to be pulled into the adventure with. It also makes the monsters scarier - rather than being in a distant galaxy, they are in the neighbourhood, viciously attacking people and destroying whatever they come across. On the other hand, it would have been cool to see some more of the war torn Eternia and the planet's weird inhabitants and locations, but MotU had a relatively small budget, so that sort of stuff was off limit anyway. A little too much time is spent on the almost soap-opera angle of Julie and Kevin, but it helps flesh out their characters to make them believable.\\nMotU is also packed with action, and we do mean packed. There is an outbreak of violence every 15 minutes or so, usually even less, and there is variety and imagination among the content, unlike many action films, which consist of repetetive shoot outs and nothing more. It could possibly be said that it's quantity over quality, as some of it, particularly the shoot-outs, are badly filmed, and none of the action ever reaches adrenalin pumping. However, it's good enough, in-yer-face and quite exciting to watch, with He-Man taking out hordes of bad guys with his sword, laser beams everywhere, mass destruction and some good old rough and tumble. And all the action grows organically from the story - none of it seems put in simply because the movie needed an action scene at a certain point.One of MotU's greatet assets is it's atmosphere. The sense of an intergalactic civil war is tangible, as is the sheer menace of the villains, the desperation of the good guys, the growing sense of doom as Skeletor captures the Cosmic Key. There is a cower-behind-the-sofa scariness similar to that of TV's Doctor Who.If Masters of the Universe was re-released at cinemas this summer, people would realize how good it is compared to the blockbuster summer fare we get these days. And all for $17m, which was hardly anything, even in 1987.\",\n",
       " \"Might as well get right to it, then. At the risk of sounding like a contrarian, I did not love this film. Do I love elements of this? Yes. Is this a 5-star masterpiece? Unfortunately, no. The cinematography here at least, is masterful. Director Christopher Nolan has, without a doubt, reached the pinnacle of on-screen spectacle here. The feats of practical effects in this film are breathtaking. The casting of nearly 6,000 extras, authentic WWII vehicles, and shooting on location in Dunkirk, France contribute to a great sense of scale here. There is ongoing trend of action films in recent years of relying on CGI, and thankfully Nolan bucks that trend. Similar to War for the Planet of the Apes, much of the film plays out without much dialogue, leaning on just the score and sound design in most scenes. It almost goes without saying that Hans Zimmer delivers with another incredible score. The sound design is also extremely well crafted, which, paired with Nolan's great work behind the camera, truly transports you to the Battle of Dunkirk. The wailing of planes passing above, the drone of gunfire, and the roar of explosions all contribute to the complete immersion into the world these characters are trapped in. This results in some of the most immersive wartime action scenes since Saving Private Ryan.This film has and will continue to be compared to World War II classic Saving Private Ryan. Both films are beautifully filmed WWII period pieces with casts that deliver great performances. The similarities end there. Whereas Saving Private Ryan was engrossing as a narrative due to it's characters with depth and arcs, Dunkirk instead leans on it's subject matter and spectacle.And while the subject matter of Dunkirk is fascinating, as a film it lacks emotional firepower due to the absence of a strongly written protagonist. This is strangely uncharacteristic of a director of Nolan's caliber, especially when you recall the complex character work in his most acclaimed films: The Dark Knight, Memento, and The Prestige. Instead of focusing on a single character or single group of characters, the focus is spread across three protagonists in completely different situations. Showing the Dunkirk Evacuation through the three different perspectives of those on the beach, the sea, and the air is only an interesting proposition on paper. The narrative, due to this writing choice, is spread far too thin, with few characters getting enough screen time to develop even the mildest emotional connection.While the characters in this film aren't written to even remotely be compelling, the great work from this cast is not to be overlooked. Harry Styles, known for being a member of English boy band One Direction, is surprisingly excellent here in his acting debut. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, and Fionn Whitehead also all give standout performances despite the limited screen time they are given. I should love this film. Historical drama? WWII setting? My favorite director Christopher Nolan? Amazing cinematography? Superb performances from an ensemble cast? All of these elements made me sure I would love this going in. But, Dunkirk's lack of emotional connection severely detracts from the awe-inspiring scope and technical prowess displayed. If I reviewed based on visuals alone, this is a slam-dunk, walk-off home run of a 5-star film. While a focus on grandeur and situation over character depth and emotion may work for some (it obviously worked for 98% of critics on Rotten Tomatoes), it did not work for this critic.This is without a doubt a cinematic achievement, but without an emotional core, it's impossible for this film not to feel cold and empty. Despite being a technical masterpiece, this is Christopher Nolan's most disappointing film yet.\",\n",
       " '\"The Hunt\" is the latest unflinching drama from Danish auteur Thomas Vinterberg. Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, this is an ambitious star vehicle for legendary actor Mads Mikkelsen, an icon in Denmark and familiar face around the world as well. He plays Lucas, a small-town kindergarten teacher. At its heart the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice, based on true incidents, that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved.To delve into the plot here would reveal too much. So I\\'ll just say that the film is quite dark and deals with some very difficult subject matter that can be very hard to watch at times. I\\'ll leave it to you to decide if you want to be more aware of the details by looking up a basic synopsis.This is essentially a one-man show. While supporting cast members are all up to the challenge, Lucas is on on screen virtually every moment of the movie and its overall success rises or falls on his believability. Mikkelsen\\'s delicately underplayed characterization of a man under fire likely won\\'t be appreciated or understood by all viewers. His restrained performance is remarkable and does much to make The Hunt a haunting, memorable experience. Among the children, Annika Wedderkopp\\'s portrayal of Klara is frighteningly brilliant. She steals every scene she\\'s in.The physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath. Natural lighting is used to match the heights and depths of the kindergarten children\\'s emotions. Their innocence is reflected in its intensity. When surrounded by love, they are glowing. The color palette is warm and inviting. As fear rises, they appear in shadow. The tableau turns increasingly darker as the narrative does.This is a very quiet and thoughtful experience in many ways. Nikolaj Egelund\\'s score is sparse. Editors Janus Billeskov Jansen and Anne Østerud keep the pace measured and deliberate. The focus is on the story. Long takes without dialogue are quite effective as so much is said in the eyes, in the faces, of Lucas, the kids, and townsfolk. Cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen allows the lush landscape of the Danish countryside to lull the viewer into a sense of peace, in contrast with the turmoil just under the surface, ready to jump out like a demon in a horror film. But these are real life nightmares, not the product of a genre writer\\'s imagination, which chill to the bone.Hollywood could never touch this subject and have anywhere near the impact. Backed independently by Swedish and Danish production companies, director Vinterberg actually intended to set and shoot the picture in Canada but better tax incentives and financing led him back to his native country of Denmark. It doesn\\'t matter, though. This is the kind of isolated little village that can be found anywhere in the world.\"The Hunt\" was easily the saddest film I\\'ve seen all year but in a cathartic way that only a great work of art can accomplish. It\\'s a gritty and hard-hitting statement on our judgmental society that pulls no punches in its recounting of a controversial ripped-from-the-headlines story, repeated all too often in recent history, that\\'s both poignant and polarizing in its authenticity.It was difficult for me to hold back tears during the screening. I broke down several times. Many will be touched by certain scenes more than others, but \"The Hunt\" is one of the most affecting and emotional films I\\'ve ever seen and one of the best of 2012.',\n",
       " 'The very definition of \"not for everyone\", Tusk is an oddball, absurd, twisted midnight movie that plays more like a demented fever dream than a horror or comedy film. I\\'d never recommend it to anyone I intend to ever speak to again.Here are the reasons why you won\\'t like it:1) It\\'s unexpectedly surreal, with little interest in the laws of reality, or at least modern medicine and police work. And it\\'s not directed in an obviously surreal, arty fashion like, say, a David Lynch picture, which makes it even harder to wrap your head around.2) It\\'s got an odd tone. There\\'s comedy, sure, but it\\'s mostly a slower, more cringe- inducing variety than Kevin Smith is typically known for. There\\'s suspense, and a bit of gross-out, but the film evokes more unease than outright scares, and the grotesqueries are more evocative of a nightmare after eating one too many sliders than, say, Saw. And it swings freely between the two with no warning at all.3) You haven\\'t seen Tod Browning\\'s \"Freaks\", a classic bit of cult cinema that Smith has made references to in other films. In fact, you probably don\\'t even know it exists. (Cinephiles will notice rather direct references to many of Kev-O\\'s other favorite movies as well, including Silence of the Lambs and Jaws.)4) You\\'re Canadian, and your country and culture are No Laughing Matter.If for some reason none of the above applies to you, may I recommend \"Tusk\"? It\\'s oddball, gonzo, at times self indulgent and slow, but also occasionally very funny and strangely thought-provoking, provided you\\'re willing to go along for the ride.

       " \"There's more than a few reasons to hate `Scream'; the main reason would be that the film single-handedly resurrected the teen-slasher genre, a movie category that had long been beaten to death.  Because of the success of `Scream', witless horror crap like `I Know What You Did Last Summer' and `Urban Legend' got greenlighted, half the teenage casts of various WB television shows got summer acting jobs, and some awful scripts that should've been left dead and buried `Teaching Mrs. Tingle' got to see the light of day.  `Scream' is responsible for a lot of garbage.  But the truth of the matter is, `Scream' is also a phenomenal movie.The plot of `Scream' is very simple: a masked knife-wielding maniac is busy stalking the students of High, killing them off one by one.  The killer's inordinately obsessed with one girl, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who of course gets involved in the quest to unmask the killer.  The catch (in case you don't already know it), though, is brilliant.  Everyone in the film is familiar with all the slasher film conventions.  They know that you shouldn't walk in the woods alone at night.  They know that having wild sex is an unwritten invitation to be hacked to pieces.  They know not to say things to each other like `I'm going outside for a cigarette; I'll be right back.' -- such statements are virtual death warrants.   One of the best examples (and best characters) of this is Randy (Jamie Kennedy), the film-obsessed nut of the film, who actually goes so far as to muse what `real' actors and actresses should play the other characters in the film, going so far as to joke about who gets to be Tori Spelling.  All the dumb conventions of slasher films are pulled out of the shadows, exposed for what they really are . . . and then, some of them get used anyway, because the characters willingly choose to ignore those conventions.  Some cliches are thrown away, while others are embraced.  `Scream' really turned the horror/slasher film genre on its ear, becoming the first truly suspenseful and exciting slasher film in many, many years simply because it suddenly had a million new avenues to explore.  The film's self-awareness allowed to move in brand-new directions . . . and suddenly, scenes that used to be predictable in other slasher films suddenly become incredibly intense in `Scream'.Director Wes Craven was perfect for this film -- as director of slasher classics like `Nightmare On Elm Street', he easily sets the visual feels and style of film to perfect evoke all the slasher films of yore . . . and then, much like `Scream's' script, chooses to either faithfully follow the tried and true, or to go off in competely unexpected directions.  Either way, Craven manages to create a lot of absolutely nail-biting, thrilling scenes. He also doesn't hold back with the gore, which is always a plus in great slasher films.  The acting ranges from barely mediocre to good -- Neve Campbell's okay as Sidney; Courtney Cox is pretty good as tart-tongued reporter Gail Weathers; Jamie Kennedy rules as Randy the film geek; and David Arquette is utterly bland and forgettable as Deputy Dewey Riley, the sad-sack policeman.  But casts in slasher films don't particularly matter anyway; the good ones are all about suspense, terror, and gore.  And in `Scream', Wes Craven provides massive amounts of all three of those criteria.The irony is, `Scream' spawned dozens of imitators, and by spawning imitators, all the new avenues opened up by `Scream' quickly got old and boring once more.  Still, purely on its own merit, it's an excellent film. The best slasher film of all time is still John Carpenter's `Halloween', without question, but `Scream' actually runs a close second.  It's well worth watching.  Grade:  A-\",\n",

It was well directed, acted, the action scenes were actually very well done and pretty epic, and most of all it was hilarious. I doubt I stopped laughing for more than a minute or two. I don't want to give anything away so I will keep it brief, but do yourself a favor and see this in theaters with friends.PS. As a black man, I did not find Robert Downey Jr.'s character offensive at all. He was probably the most hilarious character in the movie.\",\n",
       " \"E.T. is one of my all time favorite movies. This movie blew me out of my seat as a kid, and still kills me every time I watch it. Only four or five movies have made me cry, much less sob uncontrollably. When I returned from seeing E.T. for the first time, I couldn't talk for the rest of the day. I laid in my bed and cried for about five hours.The movie still makes tears well up in my eyes and gives me a lump in my throat. I still find it profoundly moving. It's heart-breakingly sad, yet phenomenally uplifting at the same time. I had no idea a movie could be so powerful when I saw this in the movies for the first time when I was eleven.What I think makes E.T. so powerful for me now is the heart-wrenching way it has of making me long to be a kid again. I refuse to ever completely grow up, and my memories are my own, but man does this movie make me wish I was eleven again, when riding my bike was a pleasure, Matchbox cars were the greatest thing in the world, Halloween was a night of mystery and creepy fun I looked forward to all year, going to the movies was an adventure, and looking up at the stars could be a mind-blowing experience.E.T. keeps those feeling alive for me. So do a lot of other things, but E.T. is the champ. As much as my cynical adult side may want to slap Steven Spielberg around sometimes, I would happily give him a hug for his timeless gift to the world, E.T. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL.\",\n",
       " \"Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket seems like an uncompleted film, but to me that's poetic justice to one of America's uncompleted wars. The film is harsh and doesn't turn a blind eye to the atrocities of Vietnam. Kubrick is the true master of atmosphere in film. He makes you feel like you are there. Friends of mine have commented that they only like the first half of the film and that the second half falls apart. I believe Kubrick sets up the first half to be an understandable reflection of the terror that would eventually enter the lives of these soldiers during war. It is easy to identify with being picked on because we all have in some way. Not all of us, on the other hand, have fought in war. Kubrick is the master.\",\n",
       " 'Wow - this was unexpected. The trailers had me believe that after \\'Battle L.A.\\' and \\'Oblivion\\' this would be yet another bleak, action- packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about an alien invasion - what the trailers failed to convey almost entirely is that over long stretches, this is also seasoned with nearly as much humor as \\'Groundhog Day\\'. That it would invite comparisons with the Harold Ramis/ Bill Murray classic was obvious, given the time loop premise, but I never expected to what extent those comparisons would actually be justified and that this film would really tap into a similar kind of comedy. Luckily, it is all the better for it.Most unexpected of all, the main reason the comical aspects during the first half of the film work so well, is Tom Cruise\\'s character, Major William Cage. This is easily Cruise\\'s meatiest role since his turn in \\'Magnolia\\' as Frank T.J. Mackey; forget his usual stern, poster boy heroes: here he plays an entirely different character – and he really seems to relish the opportunity. I won\\'t give away too much, but be prepared to chuckle and laugh when you see a new side of Tom Cruise.Yet while this is not nearly as bleak as the trailers suggested, it certainly isn\\'t a comedy either. And it absolutely IS an action-packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about battling an alien invasion (the trailers got that right), albeit one with a funny bone and great characters. Speaking of which, the rest of the cast is also very good, especially the gorgeous Emily Blunt. It seems that no matter what she does, she always comes across as genuine and real; here she succeeds in portraying her character - a tough, seasoned soldier other soldiers refer to as \"full metal bitch\" (no kidding!) - with just the right touch of vulnerability to make her that much more believable. Bill Paxton and Brendon Gleeson are always a welcome addition to any movie, and while they are great (as usual), character-wise, they don\\'t do anything here that you haven\\'t seen them do before. As for the Sci-Fi spectacle that the trailers promised, I\\'m glad to report that the film delivers. The battle scenes are beautifully orchestrated (not the Transformer-style blur where you can\\'t make out anything anymore), and there are moments when the intensity of the fighting recalls the landing on Omaha Beach in \\'Saving Private Ryan\\' - without the gore, obviously (after all, this is PG-13). The design of the aliens - the production design in general - is incredibly well done, although I would lie if I said it was something ground-breaking and new the way the first \\'Matrix\\' was (it IS breathtaking, though).So my verdict: With one of the most inventive (adapted) scripts for an original (mega-budget) film in a long time and the best Tom Cruise we\\'ve seen in years, \\'Edge of Tomorrow\\' will have you chuckle and laugh nearly as much as drop your jaw in awe: this is what Hollywood should take as a blueprint for exciting summer entertainment henceforth. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/',\n",
       " '\"The Last of the Mohicans\" was one of the most popular and acclaimed films of 1992. Its vision of early America, as it was during the French and Indian War, is captured in its utter brutality and beauty, complete with the many driving ambitions and clashing cultures of everyone involved.This movie has a bit of everything, including action, romance, war, and passionate drama. The director, Michael Mann, knows the story well and does all but completely discard James Fenimore Cooper\\'s source material, which some have dubbed as being racist and totally unfair in its portrait of Native Americans.The story (and what a story) is all over the place, with three frontier scouts - Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis), Chingachgook (Russell Means), and Uncas (Eric Schweig) - escorting a British colonel\\'s daughters - Cora and Alice Munro (Madeleine Stowe and Jodhi May respectively) - to safety at the besieged Fort William Henry. Major Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) rivals Hawkeye for Cora\\'s affections and a vengeance-driven Huron named Magua (Wes Studi) seeks to have both daughters killed in retribution for the loss of his own children.This is by far Mann\\'s best film yet (it ranks #15 on my all-time favorite movies list) and he uses the lush wilderness settings to great effect. He also makes good use of the editing, which actually comes in handy when showcasing the brutal violence that dominates much of the film\\'s action sequences. The film\\'s last 20 minutes are a definite stunner that can only be described as classic and vicious.This is a great movie that shows America in its infancy, complete with the rivalries, intrigue, and violence that I\\'m sure was an everyday part of life during this hectic time period.10/10',\n",
       " 'They could never make a film like this today. If they did, it would have an all-star cast, a loud, obtrusive score, and dizzying, roller-coaster camera effects. Back in the 70s they had to get by on talent, imagination and audacity alone. Luckily, they had plenty of that back then. This is not a \\'twisted\" film, at least anywhere nearly as twisted as say, \"Bad Boy Bubby\" or \"Sonny Boy\" (now those movies are reeeeally twisted!), but then what can one expect from Hollywood? This movie is like Diabolique made as a 1970s TV movie-of-the-week with a drive-in sleaze chaser. There\\'s definitely a lack of credibility in this movie\\'s plot - not that a woman couldn\\'t keep her grown son in the mental state of a six-month infant. That\\'s plausible and has happened before, but it\\'s extremely unlikely that the authorities who knew about this kid all those years wouldn\\'t have insisted on special schooling and therapy from day one. But who cares? Here we\\'ve got a film with two wicked Barbie Doll sisters who have venom in their veins and just looove to tease men. There\\'s some great bad seventies fashion and a \\'wild party\\' scene (well, wild for the suburbs. Ahh, Hollywood \\x96 so out of touch!). And what can you say about Ruth Roman? She\\'s Joan Crawford, Bette Davis and Ernest Borgnine all rolled into one. They just don\\'t make broads like that anymore! As mentioned by others, there are lots of twists and turns in the plot, but most anyone can figure them out very early on. But again, who cares? This movie works because of its audacity in the face of its conventionality and well, there is an intelligence at work somewhere in the midst of its drive-in movie formula. Take that whole scene with the babysitter for instance (for those who haven\\'t seen this, you\\'ll just have to see for yourself). I knew what was going to happen, but the way it built up so naturally seemed very honest and real. Which is why it freaked me out so much. Every now and then the film slips that comfort rug out from under you. Freak city! Then it relaxes safely in the realms of convention, but that\\'s okay too because the whole movie has such charming camp appeal. Let\\'s make that clear: this is a camp movie, NOT a horror movie! It\\'s stupidly being marketed as horror, so it\\'s understandable that the kiddies who are looking for lots of gore and boobies are feeling disappointed. Stick with Argento, kids! Oh yeah\\x85 huge kudos to David Mooney (Manzy \\x96 whatever) who played \\'Baby\\'. He should have become a star.',\n",
       " \"I loved this movie, it's so funny :D one of the best comedy movies ever!!! It has (like many movies) a message, that it's best to tell the truth, but above all it was very funny. My favorite scene was: About Mr. Allen Miranda: Well, what do you think of him? Fletcher: He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless steaming pile of cow dung, figuratively speaking. a moment passes and Mr. Allen starts laughing. The other board members follow his lead and start laughing also] Mr. Allen: That's the funniest damn thing I have ever heard. You're a real card, Reede. I love a good roast. Do Simmons. Fletcher: Simmons is old. He should have been out of the game years ago but he can't stay home because he hates his wife. You have met her at the Christmas parties, she's the one that gets plastered and calls him a retard, and you, Tom; you're the biggest brown nose I have ever seen. You have got your head so far up Mr. Allen's ass, I can't tell where you end and he begins. Mr. Allen: *roaring with laughter* Priceless! *Fletcher continues with every member* Fletcher: You have bad breath caused by gingivitis. You couldn't get a porn star off. Your hairpiece looks like something that was killed crossing the highway. I don't know whether to comb it or scrape it off with a shovel and bury it in lime. Loser! Idiot! Wimp! Degenerate! *Slut*! Mr. Allen: I like your style, Reede! That's just what this stuffy company needs - a little irreverence! Fletcher: Good! I'll see you later, dick-head! Great movie!!!\",\n",

Highly recommend seeing it in theaters just for the amazing animation style.\",\n",
       " '\"Dark Passage\" offers a different take on the San Francisco noir genre. This is a movie in which we get to know about the story that unfolds in front of us told in narrative style by the hero, who is never seen until about one hour into the picture. Delmer Daves, adapting the David Goodis novel has created something seldom seen in this type of films, in which, the hero\\'s presence is required at all times.The film has a great style, as it offers a view of the San Francisco of the 1940s in ways that hadn\\'t been seen before. The director was lucky to be able to open up the book in excellent ways to keep the viewer hooked from the start. The \\'moderne\\' style of that era is seen in glorious detail, especially Irene\\'s apartment, where much of the action takes place. The effect of the glassed enclosed elevator makes a dramatic contribution to the look of this movie.The story of an innocent man, falsely condemned to prison for killing his own wife, parallels other movies. What\\'s unusual here is that the presence of this convict is seen in another light with his own slant in to what really happened to the dead woman. There are other elements in the film that make it appealing. as the relationship between the escaped man, Vincent Parry, and the woman who rescues him, Irene Jansen.Sidney Hickox\\'s stylish cinematography is one of the best assets of the film. The crisp images that one sees of the city, or the surrounding areas, add to the enjoyment of watching the mystery unfold. The mood is set by the swing music of the time as Frank Waxman\\'s score is heard. Richard Whiting contributes the great song one hears in the background.The film is dominated by Humphrey Bogart, which says a lot about his power as an actor, and as a personality. When one considers he is actually not seen completely until after an hour into the movie, it speaks volumes of how the actor and the director were able to pull it through. The Irene Jansen of Lauren Bacall is another of the things that work in the film. Ms. Bacall\\'s radiant beauty dominates every scene she is in. This actress had such a style that no matter what she is doing, she pulls our attention to her. The camera loved Ms. Bacall.The other best thing going for the film is the strong performances Mr. Daves has obtained from his cast. Agnes Moorehead makes a phenomenal appearance as the evil Madge Rapf. Her last scene with Mr. Bogart stands as one of the best moments in a film noir of the era. Ms. Moorehead\\'s expressions as she is confronted with the facts, keep on changing as she absorbs everything being thrown at her. Clifton Young who plays Baker, the opportunistic would be criminal, is also effective, as he adds a layer of intrigue with an angle we didn\\'t figure out existed. His fight with Parry at the bottom of the Golden Gate bridge is beautifully choreographed. Finally, the kind cab driver Sam, who helps Parry assume a new identity, as played by Tom D\\'Andrea is one of the highlights of the film, as well as the plastic surgeon, portrayed by Houseley Stevenson.This film, while not perfect, shows how well Delmer Dave\\'s gamble paid in his conception for the film.',\n",
       " 'This is a movie where more talent than necessary has been invested in a film basically aimed at entertainment-seeking adolescents, people interested in dance routines, and a few older men who enjoy watching young girls jump about. It follows the fortunes of an award-winning cheerleader team and the hapless football team they support.A film about cheer leading, something that is, as far as I know, a uniquely American phenomenon, sounds pretty cheesy. The remarkable thing is that the acting and dialogue raise it a bit above the minimum required and the cheer leading dance sequences are a revelation for anyone who thought it was just about waving arms in the air and shouting support for the football team.Gabrielle Union (10 Things I Hate About You) and Kirsten Dunst (Drop Dead Gorgeous & Virgin Suicides) were both cheerleaders at school - did this help with the authenticity? The amazing routines are quite dazzling to watch - requiring a very high level of stamina, physical fitness, athletic ability and dance technique. The overhead panning brings them almost to the level some of the old song and dance movie scenes with synchronized dancing. Synchronized dance in itself is difficult stuff, but fast paced synchronized dancing (to a great soundtrack, by the way) involving major aerial throws, difficult jive moves and lots of personality thrown in, is quite an achievement.The film never takes itself too seriously, from the football announcer who says at the end of the match, \"our next defeat is scheduled for next Tuesday\", to the out-takes while the credits roll, the attitude is firmly tongue in cheek.The script includes plenty of teenage bitching reminiscent of Clueless (adolescents often seem to show their intellectual prowess at clever, and often vicious repartee, that is all par for the course), but the acting is convincing and even the awkward issues of race and homosexuality are handled well. One cannot but help congratulate them for making a good film out of such a flimsy premise.',\n",

However, for this film, I'm happy to make the effort.Words cannot describe how uncomfortable I felt watching the film. The social awkwardness, miscommunication and remote setting make this a very uncomfortable movie to watch. Not to mention the last 30 minutes, where the film turns from a psychological thriller to a twisted horror with horrendous graphic violence (I mean that in the good sense).I was not yet familiar with Christian Tafdrup's work, but he is definitely putting himself on the map with this film.Suitable for: People who don't want to sleep at night and have had a lot of fun watching movies like Hereditary and Midsommar.Not suitable for: People who are going to watch this with their partner.

       " 'Where do I begin? As a lifelong Star Trek fan I had an uneasy feeling while watching this movie. I could not shake the sense that I was just looking at another mediocre summer popcorn flick; an experience that would evaporate from my brain just hours after I leave the theater.I remember sitting in the cinema with my head low embarrassed by the movie, although I wanted it to prove me wrong ever since I saw the \"Beastie Boys\" trailer back in 2015. Instead, it dragged along with that \"proven\" Hollywood formula of what a summer hit should look like. Constricted by its own creative limitations I was looking at a product that was not a science fiction in its core, but a creation that had only one intention since its birth: to milk as much money as possible.Star Trek Beyond was so devoid of the primordial concepts set up by Mr. Gene Roddenberry that it contributed to the confused identity of the picture. The plot of the movie is so \"light\" in its essence that it lacks the moral dilemmas, the exploration (inner and outer) and the development usually present in the Star Trek universe. There was neither message nor any character evolution and we did not learn more about anything really. Instead of Kirk, Spock and Scotty you could stick just any name over the protagonists and nobody would have noticed. The story was atrocious and full with plot holes patched up by unnecessary although flashy looking CGI. Star Trek Beyond also has one of the weakest villains in its history. It was definitely not the actors fault and such a shame to waste the opportunity of having a strong artist like Idris Elba. It was the fault of the writer and the director who missed the opportunity to take Star Trek back on its track. Instead they created a cute flick full with needless CGI scenes, explosions and dialogue written for \"dumb\" audiences. Everything had to be explained to the viewers, nothing was left to the imagination. There was nothing to debate with your friends after the movie or something to stir your imagination or to push you to prod its meaning. Nothing like that at all, everything was given on a run-of-the-mill plate for the audience to consume in a shortest possible time frame.The movie had its moments, so not everything was complete rubbish. I liked the character of Jaylah and some of the humor, but that was it. Some of the scenes were of course visually impressive though sometimes things would fly around too much and contaminate the image. Of course this movie was done by people, who know their job, but I am not pondering the execution and the skill of the artists, I am merely concerned about the soul of this thing we love so much. This thing we used to know of as Star Trek.',\n",
       " \"Der Untergang makes you live the horrors and craziness of war. Bruno Ganz's interpretation of Adolf Hitler is worthy of an Oscar. He is completely believable. Also the rest of the cast performs admirably. You feel transported to Berlin as it was bombarded by the Russians. You get a very clear insight (or an impression?) in how the military decisions were taken during those final days of the war. The movie balances well between large-scale effects of bombs exploding in ruined streets and depictions of different persons going though the experience \\x96 from Hitler and his staff in the well-protected bunkers to the principal military commanders torn between reason and loyalty and German civilians trapped in an inferno. The movie is neither pro-Nazi nor does it depict all Nazis as mindless monsters. It gives an impression of utter realism. Go see it in a good cinema \\x96 your seat will tremble as the bombs explode.

       " \"The acting was fine, especially the daughter. But the writing was just terrible. I hate when adults write for kids and make them speak like they are 22 years old. There is no chance in hell that kid was that smart and intuitive.Second, there is no chance in hell a bank calls you and tells you about a check that bounced and then gives you who it was written out to, and then say that can waive the fee if you add money to your account They were rich so why would there even being sufficient funds? Never happened. And this is just one example where writers blow it. They don't need to add scenarios that don't happen in real life because it distracts us from what could have been good.Overall, this film was all over the place and served no real purpose. Besides their relationship never had in basis in reality. There was no rhyme or reason to it and no explanation whatsoever of how they went from seemingly distant to passionate for each other. It was bizarre.Did she ever wear something besides the black dress?Good luck trying to figure out what this film is about. It made no sense whatsoever.

       " 'Let me just say that with all of the remakes that have been coming out, King Kong may have been the most deserving and the most in need of being remade. I could not think of a better director for this type of film than Peter Jackson.King Kong stays pretty true to the original. Naomi Watts plays Fay Wray\\'s Ann Darrow perfectly. Right down to her emotional connection with Kong, which is helped by the fact that Kong is pretty darn lovable when he is not ripping apart dinosaurs.Adrien Brody plays a great Jack Driscoll as well. Brody is truly a gifted actor and plays a good hero.Even Jack Black did a good job as the rebellious director Carl Denham. Usually I am annoyed by Black\\'s performances, even though they are mostly in comedies. Surprisingly, Black kept his character serious and the movie is better for it. I though for sure he would be the one to ruin this movie for me but, again, I stand corrected. The comedy seemed to be reserved for Kong, himself, and did a wonderful job.I can not express how much more I enjoyed this movie without the \"guy in the suit\" special effects. Kong was very appealing visually, as well as the other dinosaurs. I do not say this too much in reviews. In fact, I doubt I have ever said it but King Kong has turned out to be a masterpiece which will raise the bar for many years to come. 10/10',\n",
       " \"With the success of the first X-Men movie in 2000, Bryan Singer pretty much paved the way for all the comic book movies we see today. That included a certain super hero movie made by Sami Rami in 2002 where a nerdy guy (Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a radioactive spider and inherits superhuman powers. If Singer had paved the way, then Rami provided the icing on the cake: a faithful, smart, well-acted super hero flick that had as much heart and sincerity packed in as it had all those set pieces. It also lead to a superior sequel and the much maligned, though underrated, third episode.Which brings us to what we have here: while not a beat for beat remake, you get the same story more or less with a different love interest and villain. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) sneaks into a research facility and gets bitten by a radioactive/genetically enhanced spider. He gets super powers and becomes Spider-Man. Meanwhile, a doctor (Rhys Ifans) working at the same facility, is being forced to close down his research into tissue regeneration. In desperation, he injects himself with an untested self-generating lizard vaccine and becomes\\x85 a half man/half lizard thing. Spider-Man is then forced into action to stop him from spreading this contagion throughout the city of New York. Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) is the damsel in distress/love interest and plays a role in trying to stop the crazed beast.First things first: this is not a bad film. It's well acted by all the principals, has good effects, a scary and menacing villain, some nice action sequences and web swinging effects that are generally slightly more realistic than the Rami version. Parker is more evidently scientific and intelligent here. Also the police's notion that Spider-Man is a menace to the public is more clearly defined, especially in the scene where he disarms an officer. The new idea is that Parker can hear the movements of spiders and it's a good addition. So where does it all go wrong? The short answer: it's just that it's so\\x85 pointless. We had already seen the story before. There was absolutely no reason to tell it again. This movie could easily have been Spider-Man 4 with Andrew Garfield filling in the Spidey spandex instead of Tobey Maguire. But Marvel – in their infinite wisdom – just chose to tell the same story a second time. Going by that rationale, presumably Andrew Garfield will be cast aside like a disused sock when they inevitably choose to 'reboot' the franchise again in ten years or so. It is a scarily unimaginative tactic and it is one they will continue to do until there is a massive financial failure.This movie follows the same set up as the 2002 version: Parker being picked on, getting advice from his sage-like uncle (Martin Sheen), being bitten, getting his powers/climbing walls, and turning his back on a situation which unfortunately has tragic consequences for a family member. It's all a case of been there, done that. If you want to compare it to the Rami original, then the short answer is; as good as Andrew Garfield is, Tobey Maguire was better. Maguire filled the suit better; on occasion, Garfield is prone to looking thin and scrawny during several scenes. Even the suit looked better in the Rami movies. And those earlier movies had a heart and sincerity – especially in the relationship between Peter and his aunt and uncle that you don't see here. Again we ask: why does this movie exist?And there are holes: there's a massive lizard running around, wreaking havoc; yet the police are more preoccupied with pointing their guns at Spider-Man – despite the fact that he saved a child in a (surprise, surprise) rehashed scene set on a bridge taken from Rami's first movie. In another part, the citizens of the city (once again - in a bit taken from Rami's movie) unite to help Spider-Man cross the city using tower cranes – despite the fact that there are buildings all around him. Heck, even the villain is initially a do-gooder like Norman Osborn and Dr. Octavius – again from the Rami movies.It also seems to pull inspiration from another super hero movie: Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005) in that it's slightly darker, tells such a large origin story that just like Batman Begins, Spider-Man doesn't actually show up on screen for the first hour. So if you take two parts Batman Begins and add a touch of Rami's Spider-Man, the result is what you have here. Additionally, the introduction of the web shooters, while being faithful to the original comics and emphasizing Parker's intellect, is a bit of a mixed blessing. The notion of the web being an organic material rather than being fired from mechanical devices actually made more sense.It's not that reboots are a bad idea, they're not. In certain situations they can work well, provided for example, enough time has elapsed. But there is no point in retelling the same story if the initial release is still relatively recent. In addition, it helps if the story wasn't covered well the first time, or it was a bad movie to begin with. Going by this criteria, Marvel's latest cash cow is unnecessary on all three accounts.In closing, if you haven't already seen the Rami movie from 2002, go watch it instead. If you have seen it, then this probably won't live up to it and you will be left feeling a little underwhelmed. It's fair to say that for anyone over the age of eighteen, this movie will seem rather half-hearted and senseless; for those under eighteen, this movie will probably be the greatest super hero flick ever. Yes, it's a movie that will divide opinions, primarily on the sole reason for its existence. Not a bad, or a badly made flick, by any means\\x85 just a pointless one.\",\n",
       " 'In a movie industry cluttered with own-grown hype, gimmicks and lack of idea, \"Kick Ass\" bursts onto the screen and shatters all expectations in it\\'s wake. You\\'re on this page because you think it\\'s gonna be good? Wrong. Or you\\'re here because you think it looks a decent or a good superhero movie to join the ranks of the ones you already love? DEAD wrong. Reason being, is \"Kick Ass\"doesn\\'t want to be good or above average, \"Kick Ass\" wants to be great and it has the balls to want to be original too. Seemingly impossible in a done to death genre where we\\'ve already glimpsed Mark Millar\\'s signature style in \"Wanted\", but \"Kick Ass\" is all about the unexpected.Make no mistake, nothing you believe of this movie compares to what Vaughn and co. serve up for you. Mainly because everyone involved seems determined to honour the comic and redefine a genre. Most movies entertain, but this one? It wants to BLOW YOU AWAY! Less smarter movies have done that but \"Kick Ass\" ain\\'t giving that up either. It\\'s script is razor-sharp, dumping the pretension of \"the burden of heroism\" crippling even the better superhero films, showing this in actions rather than long drawn out emoting. Matthew Vaughn has finally solved the hurdle that all superhero movies suffer, namely how to get to know and love your characters without long drawn out scenes. He does it by keeping them moving. The more they do, the more they try, the more you know and love them. And make the narrative interesting and most of all relatable so we\\'re with Dave 100% of the way, it doesn\\'t just have to functional.The real visual joy of \"Kick Ass\" is it\\'s desire to keep it simple but not at the expense of wowing us. Make characters do cool things, instead of Michael Bay-esquire things happening to them. That\\'s why they exude coolness, despite Dave\\'s almost humdrum existence. This is the everyman doing the things we could do if wanted to; not a guy from another reality or possessed with great drive and ambition. Dave wants to get laid. He wants to be hip. Even your bad guy in this is believable. Watching the whirlwind that is Hit Girl perform a routine almost straight out of Jackie Chan\\'s Hong Kong days stuns us in a way no big screen chase ever could. Visually the film takes all the thing we DID love from the movies that ultimately didn\\'t zing and churns them into a finely balanced flawless brew.Did I mention it\\'s feel good? From it\\'s inspired use of music (again utterly relatable) right down to it\\'s outstanding score, like \"Get Carter\" for superheroes; I could say more but there\\'s surprises in store.In a movie this stunning, acting is usually secondary (as any James Cameron film shows). Not a bit of it. In a cast as eclectic as the styles the film embraces you have performances that set a benchmark for all concerned. Can Mark Strong already better his stellar work? See his menacing and humorous turn as D\\'Amico, a career best. Christopher Mintz Plasse follows \"Role Models\" by breaking out of McLovin mode. His guy has layers and he can show them. Nicolas Cage as expected returns to his past glories playing larger than life eccentric characters but not without a little sadness too. Joining him is Chloe Moretz forever destined to be remembered for her first major role. She idolised Angelina Jolie apparently. Guess what, you trounced any action movie she has ever made! Moretz dominates any scenes she\\'s in, no easy task considering her fellow cast! Aaron Johnson has the most difficult job of all. Being an original uber-geek after Michael Cera set the standard (anyone who\\'s seen \"Zombieland\" knows it\\'s hard to write an original geek even in a great movie).

       " '* * * * ½ (4½ out of 5)\\nThe Thing\\nDirected by: John Carpenter, 1982\\nLooking back on John Carpenter\\'s The Thing \\x96 today a highly treasured cult favourite \\x96 one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and critics when it first came out in 1982.\\nSteven Spielberg\\'s extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide) had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office rampage. Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate of Carpenter\\'s first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was prepared \\x96 moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.\\nIt then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained such a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and critically. Carpenter\\'s version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks\\' version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell\\'s short story \"Who Goes There?\\' (on which both were based), and critics today point out how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire cast.\\nIt opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.\\nThis scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film history.\\nEnnio Morricone\\'s moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper, compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.\\nA satisfying example of a movie that today \\x96 18 years after \\x96 looks downright muscular in its simplicity.\\nThe budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his ideas better than ever before. There\\'s a brooding darkness to this film, making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic and almost angelic. Dean Cundey\\'s extraordinary photography created a palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.\\nHorror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque special effects. Be warned \\x96 there\\'s a lot of splatter and gore here. The Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find them disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a crowd of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research facility) terrorized by an alien life form.\\nWhere Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott\\'s 1979 masterpiece, his own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There\\'s a rhythm and an environment that equals Scott\\'s in every way.\\nThe husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it never barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of - DVD version).\\nWatch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at a human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that\\'s not the point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror movie.\\nCarpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection, making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.',\n",
       " 'It took a little over 24 hours before I weighed in on my official thoughts on Morten Tyldum\\'s The Imitation Game from The Weinstein Company. My initial reaction upon leaving the screening room was it was astonishing, a magnificent achievement that stands tall as one of the year\\'s best movies. As the film continues to settle within my cinematic soul, this very well could be the best film of the year, anchored by a career best performance from the amazing Benedict Cumberbatch. Full disclosure, I\\'m fairly oblivious to European history and the heroes that had a hand in one of the deadliest wars in history. I\\'ve heard the name Alan Turing from high school and college but either didn\\'t care enough to learn or have no recollection of his contributions. Minutes following the screening, Amazon.com got $15.82 from my bank account in order to read \"Alan Turing: The Enigma,\" the book in which screenwriter Graham Moore based the story upon. Telling the story of Alan Turing, a mathematician who in 1939 led a pioneer in cracking one of the most difficult codes in history. His contributions paved the way for essentially the way we exist now. However, Turing, who is a homosexual, has to wrestle with his secret in order to keep his status and his work years later.Masterfully told and encompassing an emotional complexity, Tyldum\\'s film is both engrossing and disturbing. It has genius aspirations in which it wants to exist in the cinematic world. It\\'s an impeccable thriller, taut and brilliant, exploring the horrors of war along with the choices that doom mankind for all eternity. Tyldum is methodical and precise in which he decides to unravel the story, Turing is one of the fallen heroes of our history and his story stands as one of the most tragic. Screenwriter Moore crafts a murky, dark, yet totally enjoyable spy film that stands taller than any James Bond film ever released. It\\'s a sure-fire Oscar contender for several Academy Awards including Best Picture. They should feel so lucky to have the gumption to choose something this methodical and majestic.Benedict Cumberbatch continues to climb the ladder as one of the best actors working today. After impressive performances August: Osage County, 12 Years a Slave, and TV\\'s \"Sherlock,\" this is the role that will make him a bonafide movie star. Oscar-winner or not, this will be looked upon like the greats such as Gene Hackman in The French Connection or any legendary 70\\'s movie that you love today. Cumberbatch hones in on all of Turing\\'s character flaws and good qualities that make him a real person. He constructs him from the toes up, inflicting mannerisms and behaviors that all ring true. He stimulates all the sensual beats that keep us fixated on a performance. I can\\'t help but go back to someone like Joaquin Phoenix in The Master, who delivered a construction of epic proportions. Though based on a real person, the talented Cumberbatch ignites his own masterpiece performance. He follows the demons of Turing down to his bones. Unsure, arrogant, and dismissive to the world around him, Turing shows only what he must, what he chooses, and every once in a while, we get a front seat to his soul. Thank you Cumberbatch.The rest of the cast is completely on their game. It\\'s probably a contender for the SAG Ensemble prize. Academy Award nominee Keira Knightley, as the feisty and fiery Joan Clark, is as loose and comfortable as I\\'ve ever seen her. She wears Joan like an old coat from the back of the closet. Remembering it fondly and seeing that it fits just perfect. She has all the things that make up an Oscar nominee; a scene that will likely bring you to tears, plenty of scenes that play as the comic relief in a dark tale, and being simply charming in every part of the film. I don\\'t know when it\\'s going to happen but the world needs to make Matthew Goode a mega-star. In his brief time on-screen, Goode makes his mark, becoming essentially a co-anchor with Knightley of the supporting players, showcasing a reason to give this guy his own leading role sooner rather than later. As our resident sleazy authority figure, Charles Dance shows that he\\'s still got it. Mark Strong and Allen Leech also deliver memorable, fascinating scenes, both getting an opportunity to shine.Technical merits are no shortage of excellence on display. Oscar- winning Editor William Goldenberg (Argo) shows that tension is his second language. Cutting the film to perfection, and forcing your heart into throat, this espionage thriller succeeds for general audiences because of Goldenberg\\'s efforts. It\\'s something that anyone can seek out and get fully immersed into. Alexandre Desplat tacks another impressive composition to his already thick resume. With films like The Grand Budapest Hotel already in his arsenal, I assume this to be another Oscar citation in his future. Shot by the talented Oscar Faura, responsible for painting the canvas that was J.A. Bayona\\'s The Impossible, he utilizes the standard brilliance of capturing a moment. Knows when to pull back and get close. Let\\'s not forget the Production and Costume Design by Maria Djurkovic and Sammy Sheldon Differ. Those two will surely be mentioned for the rest of the film year.The Imitation Game is assertive and makes a serious claim as one of the best spy thrillers ever made. There are sub plots that all resonate and never feel forced. This will not only keep your tension level at a fever pitch but could leave you in tears to walk home with. It\\'s a complete realistic view at the spy game that stands as one of the best films of the year and a performance for the ages from Benedict Cumberbatch. A captivating achievement that I\\'ll likely remember for some time.',\n",
       " 'OK. After seeing the previews of this movie, it was added to the list of movies I did NOT have any intentions of seeing. However, I heard so many great things about it, I decided to give it a try. Let\\'s just say, my gut feeling was correct. I have NO idea what so many people found so amazing about this movie.It\\'s not that funny. Yeah, there were a couple of scenes that I found humorous, and chuckled. However, most of the \"funny\" scenes were either involving sex, about sex, about poop/vomit/farting/burping, or a lame attempt at slapstick humor. Lots of predictable cheap shots. Seriously, no sophisticated or classy humor... the whole film made me feel trashy, honestly. I get that it\\'s rated R, but still. I felt like I was in an adult version of an equivalent to Spongebob at times.Small plot. This movie is slowly stretched out for over 2 hours, with a plot that could easily be explained entirely, with all important scenes, in about 30 minutes. There were SO many long scenes that seem to be thrown in just so Kristen Wiig can score another laugh, yet they don\\'t progress the story. Quite a few plot holes, and there were many scenes where I caught myself rolling my eyes, thinking, \"really?\" The greatest movies develop their characters so much that you literally feel for their outcomes. I left the theater with no regards to any of the characters in this movie, because they were all so distant and under-developed. The plot was so weak and rushed for the next pointless comedy spiel, that they didn\\'t give the characters any depth, except maybe the lead of \"Annie.\" I can think of 2 memorable scenes right now from this film, and I saw it last night. Yeah, there were some funny scenes, but nothing worth raving about in my opinion.I do have to give \"Bridesmaids\" some credit. An all-female leading role movie is very new in show-business, especially in comedy. Sadly, these women made the \"Hangover\" equivalent instead of raising the bar, but they get Kudos for the efforts. There were some sweet moments in the movie, that for me, held the film from turning into a complete waste of money. I do like comedy, but I prefer classier, witty humor instead of the easy, thoughtless humor. I would much rather watch a movie that evolves a character so much that the cheap shots aren\\'t needed for laughs. If you liked \"The Hangover,\" then you\\'ll probably enjoy this movie..',\n",
       " \"Don't judge a book by it's cover.  An old saying we've all heard so many times it doesn't seem to mean anything anymore.  But it does mean something, and it's important; and, before we proceed, go back and read it again.  In fact, let me help you:  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  There.  Now take a moment to think, really think about it.  And if it still doesn't mean anything, take a couple of hours and check out `Legally Blonde,' a comedy with some real teeth in it, directed by Robert Luketic and starring Reese Witherspoon.  The premise of the story has to do with upscale sorority girl Elle Woods (Witherspoon), who instead of getting the long awaited, much anticipated marriage proposal from her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), finds herself jilted as he prepares to leave for Harvard Law School.  Elle, it seems, just doesn't fit the oh-so-serious, somber profile that the wife of a future Senator must have.  It's all about image, and Elle's own 4.0 grade average earned in her `frivolous' curriculum apparently doesn't carry any weight.  Being outgoing, positive, beautiful AND intelligent just won't do among the `serious' of the `upper crust' elite.  So, because she looks good and enjoys her life, Elle is given the gate, and she just can't understand why.  She's devastated.  But she's also smart.  Smart enough to pick herself up and make a decision that stands them all on their ears. With the grades and the wherewithal to swing it, she enters Harvard Law herself, initially with the intent of winning back Warner.  But along the way she  learns something important-- about the way things really are, about people and about herself, as well.  And she sets out to prove that if there is any `shallowness' around, it's only in the minds of those who perceive her as something and someone other than what she really is.  And, for the viewer, right out of the gate this is someone you want to see succeed in her quest, because her triumph-- whatever it may be or however it comes out-- is going to be one you share right along with her.\\tMake no mistake, this is one funny movie-- in fact, it's downright hilarious at times.  But beyond the laughter it evokes, there's a flip side to the same coin.  Because beyond all of the comedy there is some serious issues at the heart of this film, and anyone who's ever been subjected to trials and tribulations simply because they didn't happen to fit a certain `mold,' or coincide with someone else's `opinions' of the way things should be, will be able to identify with Elle's situation.  And it's something you have to be aware of, because even while you're laughing at the funny stuff, at the same time it's almost painful to watch Elle endure the senseless, heartless, unnecessary and unwarranted acts that are perpetrated upon her. At the core of the matter is not only the need for tolerance and understanding, but the necessity and importance of keeping an open mind about everything that transpires around you.  Who knows what monumental contributions an individual is capable of making in this imperfect machinery we call society if they are prejudged into oblivion?  So there's a lot more to this film than meets the eye; `dumb blonde' jokes get nipped in the bud, and by using a comedy format, the filmmakers here have produced a film that is not only entertaining, but thoroughly thought-provoking, as well.\\n\\tReese Witherspoon opens herself up and gives a dynamic performance here as Elle; she conveys such a full-of-life spirit that it is easy to empathize with her, and when the hurt comes, you feel it with her.  And through it all, the way she takes it on the chin then moves on with her life makes her a role model for those who may find themselves in a similar situation.  On one hand, when Elle finds solace by getting a manicure at the local beauty shop, it makes for a falling-on-the-floor moment of hilarity, and yet you're always aware of that other side of the coin, as well.  And it makes you root for her all the more.  Witherspoon has a perky, vibrant screen presence that makes her perfect for this part, and she makes Elle a flawed and therefore very real person.  When she gets knocked down, you feel for her; and then there's that feeling of triumph when she gets back up and stands her ground. There's no question that this is Witherspoon's movie, and it's one of the best performances of her career.\\tThe supporting cast includes Luke Wilson (Emmett), Selma Blair (Vivian), Victor Garber (Professor Callahan), Jennifer Coolidge (Paulette), Holland Taylor (Professor Stromwell), Ali Larter (Brooke Taylor-Windham), Jessica Cauffiel (Margot), Linda Cardellini (Chutney), Alanna Ubach (Serena) and Oz Perkins (Dorky David), with a special appearance by Raquel Welch as Mrs. Windham-Vandermark.  An entertaining, accessible film that should be embraced by a wide audience because of the clever way in which it gets across it's message, `Legally Blonde' can be enjoyed by just taking it at face value and soaking up the jokes, but offers even greater rewards to those who really delve into it and see it as an examination of human nature. Not always, but occasionally, a movie is so much more than what it appears to be on the surface, and this is one of them.  What makes it so good is the fact that it can really make you laugh, while at the same time it's subtly telling you that there is no place for cruelty within the realm of human relationships.  It's a film that's worth seeing many times over, and that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.\",\n",
       " 'Chris Columbus said he wanted to make a 2,5 hour movie that feels like 30 Minutes. Well, in my case he surely succeeded! I saw the movie as a member of the press and couldn\\'t get enough of it. I would have gladly sat in the cinema for another two or three hours with a biiiig smile on my face.Like part one, \"chamber of secrets\" stays true to the book. I don\\'t know about you - but I HATE it when movie makers change the storylines, add or remove characters and do it for the \"sake of the art\". I think they do it because they are too lazy to create their own storys, so they rip off other peoples ideas and crush them to make it more comfortable... If a book is loved by millions of readers there must be a good reason for that. Chris Columbus has captured the essence of the book on screen. So, after \"philosophers stone\" he delivered again!When reading the book I always envisioned Michael Crawford playing Gilderoy Lockhart. His broad smile and clumsiness à la Frank Spencer would have been perfect for the role. But instead we get to see Kenneth Branagh, so of course you won\\'t see ME complain. The great find of the movie is Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy. In his short scenes onscreen he makes your blood freeze. And again: all the casting is brilliant. Every character just feels right - even if you imagined something different when you read the book. There also has been talk about the young actors getting older. Well, let me remind you that this also happens in the books. In every book Harry Potter and his friends are one year older. So there\\'s no excuse to take the roles away from Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. I couldn\\'t imagine someone else playing their parts.Go see \"the chamber of secrets\". It\\'s pure fun and excitement! And it will wet your appetite for more to come. Richard Harris couldn\\'t have asked for a better movie and legacy to be remembered by.',\n",

       " 'I\\'ve always thought Fargo would make a great Shakesperean play; you could alter the modern elements and still have created a buzz 400 years ago in suburban England. Indeed, the plot is similar to Hamlet\\'s, in that they both have characters we root for who create zany plans than end up spinning wildly out of control into bloodshed. Many people seem to like Fargo for its humorous qualities, its characterization of the Minnesotan culture and Frances McDormand- not me. I love Fargo for its brilliant writing, its tragic musical score, its tragic plot, William H Macy, Harve Presnell and Steve Buscemi, its ignorance of political correctness (how many movies can you remember when the only two minority characters were both revealed to be creeps).I want to draw attention to an overlooked reason why the film works so well - how well the music suits the visuals in this movie. Each murder scene is scored superbly, and other audio clues really add to the effect (for instance, notice how when the police officer asks Carl Showalter \"What\\'s this?\" in reference to the abductee, a disquieting guitar sound is immediately played that has an instantaneous psychological effect on how you interpret the scene). I have seen this film over, well, an embarrassing number of times and have committed its screenplay, from start to finish, by memory. Fargo is the ultimate Coen Brothers movie, a brilliant tragedy, and restores my faith in Roger Ebert as he places this movie in as his fourth favorite movie of the \\'90s.',\n",
       " \"The trailer to this film is rather misleading. It's the equivalent of advertising the whole of Disneyland with just clips of Space Mountain again and again. There's a lot more going on here than Ryan Gosling robbing banks and being a general badass in The Place Beyond The Pines. There are in fact at least three main characters all with their own story. And while the Ryan Gosling section is, a bit like Space Mountain at Disney, the best bit of the package he is only one part of a much bigger picture. A motor bike stunt rider finds out he has a son so packs in his day job and takes the logical step of robbing banks to provide for him. The story deals with the family life of the man as well as a rookie cop who exposes his police department to be corrupt. I found the film very absorbing from the start with Ryan Gosling's character development on fast forward so at least 3 massive life events all happen in the first 20 minutes of the film. There's not a lot of action scenes but when there are they're very tense and exciting. The family life aspect is quite heartwarming and you do believe that his character does love his son and wants to provide for him. There are fantastic believable acting performances all round here with Ryan Gosling and later on Bradley Cooper really showcasing their acting talents. It's engaging and I really cared what happened to both of their characters. The main problem with the film is it's length and not knowing when to stop. The first part of the film is constantly engaging and would be a nine out of ten if the film stayed like that the whole way through. When the focus shifts from characters however it really doesn't feel as exciting and almost feels like the start of totally different movie. A movie that isn't bad but is nowhere near as good as the one you've just seen.Every story told is linked obviously but sometimes it feels a tad loose. There is a dramatic time shift when the film reaches the 100 minute mark and what follows really seems to drag. It never really felt like it was going anywhere. It was by no means boring however, it just lost a bit of steam towards the end. The Place Beyond The Pines is worth a watch but just be prepared to have you're socks blown off and then have them planted firmly back on your feet as the film continues.\",\n",
       " \"Secretary is the first of its kind - a very dark love story. First of its kind in that it deals with themes never seen before seen in mainstream Hollywood cinema - S&M, sexual dominance and submission.Maggie Gyllenhaal is outstanding in a potential minefield of a role - she handles it with dignity and even provides some effective dark humour.\\nThe story here is that her character, Lee, applies for a job as a secretary for the firm owned by James Spader's brilliant Mr Grey. However, Lee has a history of self-harm and masochism and Grey has a dominance complex along with a very sadistic streak. Combine these 2 in theory and you have 2 very happy people. But this is no ordinary love story...Spader, as stated, is brilliant. He brings an icy steel to the troubled Grey, but also provides a touch of black humour which comes at some great moments to 'release the tension'.For the themes supplied here you'd probably expect a lot of raunchiness - well there are sexual moments, of course, but there is nothing gratuitous, which is in itself an achievement and well handled.Overall it's quirky, off-beat, and a little bit different.Worth a view.\",\n",

Though, in truth this movie didn\\'t reveal a lot about what it was like living and fighting through the war. I understood nothing after watching the movie about how cramped or what it might be like to live, fight and die inside a tank. Instead it seemed like \"it\\'s the best job ever\" - alcohol in the pantry and (seemingly) plenty of space...The movie did provide loud noises. Colourful explosions. Some gruesome and somewhat shocking deaths. Some love. Some hate. And about as many war movie clichés as could be fit into the running time. Seriously, the end of the film will have you thinking - This is definitely an American made movie. I would still rate it as a \\'decent\\' war movie. Though, do not get your hopes up. There has been such a dry patch and nothing can come close to Saving Private Ryan or the characterisation of band of brothers series...This movie played all the stereotype characters and yes they did play well. But I wanted so much more from the film. I wanted to feel like I had learnt a bit of history or at least a bit of insight after the screening.

Which is a good thing for me but doesn't say much for the quality of the story. It feels like there was much more there somewhere but it didn't make it out. Perhaps watching it on a rainy Monday evening didn't help. Also please don't go thinking this is a comedy or anything at all like 'In Bruges'. It's very far from funny.

       " \"i was lucky enough to see this masterpiece at Frightfest this year.Pascale Laugier's worried about this movie. He was apologising to people who despised it, he was profusely thanking the people who liked it. He is the modern day equivalent of Victor Frankenstein. He knows that he has created a monster and doesn't really know how to deal with it now that it's being released upon the world.Martyrs truly is a monster. It's a ground breaking, brave, stunning, brutal & moving piece of work that is guaranteed to divide audiences everywhere it gets the chance to play. Even at a genre event like Frightfest the audience reaction ranged from 'loved it' to 'hated it' to people actually going outside of the cinema to be physically sick (really). For me it was the highlight of the festival and i absolutely loved it but I don't believe it's a movie that anybody will truly 'enjoy'.As others have already given away too much of the story i won't bother with a synopsis as Martyr's is definitely a dish best served cold. Not knowing what to expect makes this a refreshingly shocking piece of celluloid that will hopefully astound you with it's gutsy originality. Written by the director during a fit of depression (that he did not elaborate on in the Q&A) it is an almost schizophrenic movie with two distinct halves and coda of such ambiguity that it is possible to view it as nihilistic or strangely hopeful. It's beautifully shot, really well paced and contains outstanding performances from the two female leads.This movie is inevitably going to be compared to Hostel and other movies in the horribly monickered 'torture-porn' genre and that is a genuine mistake. Martyrs bears more resemblance to movies like Nacho Cerda's Aftermath as there is nothing here that is designed to be titillating. The true horror lies in the the clinical detachment of the antagonists. In the end, despite all the on screen violence (and there are some truly brutal scenes on display here in the movies second act) the prevaling reaction that this movie elicited in me was not one of revulsion but one of true sadness. Martyrs really is a truly brilliant, surprisingly moving film and one that will remain in my mind, jostling for attention with my other thoughts for a very long time to come. Thankyou Pascale Laugier for creating a monster that i love...\",\n",

You would think the meta aspect is old by now, but nothing feels old if it\\'s done well. It has one of the most meta scenes in movie history, and I loved it. It\\'s funny, awesome and creepy, constantly keeping you at the edge of your seat.I can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this, but this fifth entry in the franchise is my favorite. I liked them all except for Scream 3, but this feels better in so many ways.The writing is extremely clever, to the point where it feels like they\\'re toying with the audience, and the audience likes it! No more stupid character decisions like the previous sequels. In fact, there are numerous moments where the characters do the smartest thing possible.But what\\'s the biggest improvement?

All of the brutal kills still made my jaw drop and the big moments still gave me the feels.This movie is so fast-paced.

An unfunny, poorly written, poorly edited, contrived cash-in on a beloved classic which has some of the poorest dialogue and worst performances I've seen in a while. The computer generated effects were like something out of a live action Disney picture. The music, in particular the theme tune was uninspiring and added no impact or energy to the movie. I honestly can't think of any redeeming qualities that this film has. After waiting so long for a new Ghostbusters film this comes as a major disappointment. Some things are just best left alone.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m almost convinced film critics are paid off...I thoroughly enjoyed this movie more than most of the \"critically acclaimed\" films I\\'ve watched this year. This movie had everything- love, drama, philosophical/existential questions, and incredibly suspenseful moments (and not just action scenes!!). The acting was great, pacing was good (never was bored), and the visuals were amazing as well. Also the trailer didn\\'t spoil the movie at all, which was nice. My only gripe would be about the ending, which was still fine.Overall would really recommend watching over the holidays. Really enjoyed it.',\n",

       " 'The reviews for \"The Devil\\'s Advocate\" were not too kind, to say the least. But what did the critics refuse to see in this? With movies nowadays being nothing but flashy, over-the-top, masturbatory, CG-fests, \"The Devil\\'s Advocate\" holds up like osmium.The cinematography is good because it\\'s quite understated and that\\'s a virtue in today\\'s cinema. The acting, while containing pretty lame Southern accents, is still pretty good. Even from Keanu, dude.Sorely forgotten in it\\'s day, the script tells a very deep, original and interesting story, with lots of development, respect for the characters, delicate pacing, and a head-spinning ending. The movie is solely about the people and their struggles. Fear takes hold of the audience through the dialogue.Think of \"The Devil\\'s Advocate\" as Woody Allen trying his hand at a horror/thriller and succeeding. This movie never makes you jump, but it puts you in a general state of discomfort through it\\'s atmosphere. As with all memorable supernatural dramas, this one handles its spectacle with discretion and grace.Isn\\'t that what we hope to see when we watch any movie? 10/10',\n",

It was clever, emotional, and left me crying after the movie. The twist was done really well, and I almost wanted to pause the movie. Also, the animation is gorgeous. You get to see detailed images from many angles and perspectives, and there were hundreds of animators! The credits didn't start out with the cast like it usually would. The first thing you saw after a black screen was hundreds of names of animators and designers. I watched this movie again and I still felt my muscles ready to let tears out.

I had NO intention of seeing it, but once I did, I cannot tell you how much I loved it.This is the Farrley Brothers at their funniest. The idea is simple, a guy (Ben Stiller) who had a crush on a woman (Carmen Diaz) he knew since high school and continued to yearn for her privately, finally getting an opportunity to try to reconnect what never got going. This is something almost everyone can identify with.What makes this work...is its a dead-on hard hitting comedy.  The Farrley Brothers spared no one: male or female, handicapped or able bodied, black or white, rich or poor, job or not, straight or gay, animal or vegetable, blonde or brunette, educated or not. It is NOT a cinematic masterpiece so don\\'t look for one, it is not a punch line comedy or slapstick comedy, it is sophomore humor done very well because you\\'re going to be laughing at what you think you shouldn\\'t no matter how much you want to say you would never laugh at something like that. Plus the Farrley Brothers added in \"some things\" that...well... may have just happened to you at some point in your adolecence, and put a comedic/gross quality to it that shocks you into laughing at it. All through the film you might laugh because you\\'re thinking, \"Better them than me\".....even if it was you!Not for eveyone\\'s taste, even those who think they know comedy, but this is that kinda comedy that is hard to do once you\\'ve reached maturity and forgotten what it was like to laugh at simple things.

It is the most erotic film I have ever seen, but still it is one the most beautiful love stories ever released.It tell us about being open to new experiences, about belief in kindness and good human nature, love and tenderness, life in its very sense. It also gives you a formula how to fall in love and then say goodbye the way it hurts no one. It gives you a felling of happiness. It gives you a magic.Getting out of the movie theater, you find yourself inspired, relaxed and feeling harmony. And while the story begins and seems to end right before your eyes and possibly it never be the same for you as for the characters, you feel grateful for taking this moment and sharing it with you.

       " 'I think there are some good reasons to criticize this film. It\\'s a fairly stage bound adaptation of a play. That\\'s not always a bad thing. In many cases, staging a film very similarly to the way the play was staged accentuates what works about the play. I don\\'t think it really does here, and the film\\'s repetitive structures leads to some dead patches. There\\'s also a powerfully melodramatic tone to this film that I\\'m frankly just a bit unsure of.I also think there are extremely bad reasons to criticize the film, and these reasons are starting to emerge as the consensus among critics in the mainstream media. This isn\\'t a film about a very fat man. It\\'s a film about someone with an extremely destructive eating addiction caused by grief and regret and the complete lack of self-worth that accompanies those feelings sometimes. There have been films that deal with drugs, alcohol, gambling and sex, but apparently when it comes to food, the only thing that this film can be doing is inviting you to gawk at the big fat guy. It\\'s a very strange conclusion to reach that I speculate is generated by coming into the film dead set on the idea that this is all it can be doing.I did not come away from this film with any notion that I was supposed to see Frasier as anything less than a human being deserving of our deepest empathy. The film parades in some shocking imagery, especially up front, but I found that once I confronted it, my initial reaction subsided and I was seeing Frasier for who he was. I think it\\'s an extraordinary double-standard that people can watch Nicolas Cage indulge in ridiculous and cartoonish bouts of binge drinking in \"Leaving Las Vegas\" and declare brilliance, but balk at Frasier\\'s fits of VERY CLEARLY self-annihilating eating in this film and think we are only supposed to be processing it as some kind of freak show.I don\\'t think this is an incredible film, and I wouldn\\'t place it among Aronofsky\\'s best. I do think Frasier\\'s performance is brilliant, and the film is a flawed, but often marvelous character piece about a kind of addiction we seldom confront.',\n",

       " \"I cant believe some people have scathed this great film. It deserves a lot higher rating.I got this movie out thinking it was going to be a brainless splatter fest. But after watching it in completion I was bowled over ..I wasn't expecting to be challenged by its visuals as well as with the sociological lessons and questions it raised.The film is real, genuine and honest to the subject topic: 'Barbarity' can be innate in all humans.It can be argued that humans coming into the homo-sapiens stage of evolution survived and expanded because of what is now considered barbarous savage ways. Savagery was a survival tool. We came from barbarity...and to an extent we still are savages.Though the acting is poor in most places ...the film director portrays cannabilism and barbarism ...and portrays it rather intelligently.Obvious connotations can be made to Blair Witch Project. I'm sure the crew that made BWP was inspired by this movie.The film follows a Professor investigating the disappearance of an American film team (3 guys and girl) that went into the jungle of South America to film a documentary about the native cannibals.The Professor with a couple of jungle assistants venture into the jungle to trace the lost Americans footsteps. He manages to get on the trail and slowly uncovers the grizzly ways of the jungle tribes! By carefully befriending these natives he captures the lost film reels and returns back to his skyscraper clad conurbation.In amongst the film there is the media business cogs turning. The dilemma of TV executives battling with the Professor to air the once lost footage on TV for the viewing public. The professor is reluctant.The professor seems the only person possessed with moral understanding and compassion throughout the film ..everyone else it seems is after ratings, fame, money or blood.The film commences its ending by playing back the raw footage of what the expedition team filmed...and it is shocking. Questions arise: Who is committing the real 'evil' savagery here?As for the animal cruelty scenes: Yes they are real and shocking. But should it be anymore shocking than the beef burger that is served up in McDonalds. Cows are slaughtered everyday. Perhaps one needs to watch a bovine neck getting slit before they take it for granted they are eating a nice juicy steak on their plate. The film portrays the reality of human meat consumption...and yes all kinds of animals are killed for the human appetite, especially in the wild - someone will do it! For those who dispute this film on these grounds 'Can you handle life?' This stuff still goes on regardless of whether u see it happen or not.This film is absolutely brilliant. A cult classic. I can see it making a revival...but don't know when...perhaps in some years time.\",\n",
       " 'Went to see Mamma Mia without particularly high expectations. Not being a big connoisseur (or even fan) of musicals, I didn\\'t really know what to expect. Though I adore ABBA, I never bothered to watch the stage production of Mamma Mia. But having a cinema membership, I didn\\'t have much to lose (no money, at least), so I went for it. And boy, am I glad that I did! I can safely say that I enjoyed every second of it. And I\\'m not even ashamed to admit it!Give Meryl Streep another Oscar and get it over with already. If she could get a nod for the Devil Wears Prada, she definitely deserves one for this. She really let her hair down on this one. Mrs. Streep can obviously not pass for a trained singer, but somehow, it just doesn\\'t seem to matter. It just really worked in the movie (unlike -say- Helena Bonham Carter\\'s singing in Sweeney Todd). When I heard Meryl\\'s rendition of \"The winner takes it all\" in advance, it lowered my expectations considerably, but in its context, it totally made sense.Most of all though, this movie was just sheer fun. People were clapping, laughing...Rarely have I seen an audience as enthusiastic. The crowd especially responded well to Meryl and her two cronies (arguably the strongholds of the movie). Also, because I had never seen the musical before, I was amazed (and amused) at the inventive ways in which they managed to incorporate so many ABBA-songs. Equally brilliant was the way the extras (usually some Greek old women) were deployed throughout the movie...And then of course the setting (beautiful Greece) was mesmerizing...Basically, Mamma Mia is a superb musical that doesn\\'t take itself too seriously. If you\\'re just a little bit crazy and want to have a good laugh, if you love ABBA, want to see Meryl Streep like you\\'ve never seen her before or if you simply have a secret crush on Colin Firth and/or Pierce Brosnan (his singing was nothing short of hilarious), you will LOVE this movie.

This is a pretty straight-forward spy-action-adventure, with a fair bit of comedy thrown in - closer to \\'The Man From U. N. C. L. E.\\' than \\'Wrath of Man\\'. I\\'d say I liked it better than \\'The Gentlemen\\', but not as much as \\'Snatch\\'. There is only minor introductions for Orson Fortune (Statham), Sarah (Plaza) and JJ (Malone) as the spy team working for Nathan (Elwes), before we\\'re off and running.Not sure why the \"Ruse de Guerre\" suffix was needed, but it translates as a cunning war trick. I assume it also helps if there are to be sequels. The trick is that the team use actor Danny Francesco (Hartnett) as bait for billionaire arms-dealer Greg Simmonds (Grant), to track a stolen weapon. Most of the plot is quite formulaic, but Statham & Ritchie know how to stage action scenes and there\\'s plenty of exciting moments.Hartnett plays spoiled actor well; Plaza has plenty of fun; Malone, Elwes and Statham are all solid; with Hugh Grant relishing the role, having even more fun than he did in \\'The Gentlemen\\'. Not too long, satisfying ending, noting too new, but a nice mix of comedy and action with a good cast.',\n",

       " 'I will admit that when I first heard a Disney movie called \"The Princess Diaries\" was coming out, I thought it would be corny. But upon actually SEEING the film, I found (as is usually the case when stupid judgmental people make up their mind about films without watching them, I won\\'t name names, you know who you are...Tom!) that it was in reality a charming, original, humorous and thoroughly entertaining family film.The plot is fairy tale in nature: Mia is a social misfit with terrible hair and no self-confidence. Her only friends are eccentric activist Lilly and rock band headliner Michael (played by real-life rocket Robert Carmine of \"Rooney\") who has a little crush on her. Then, who of all people should turn up but Julie Andrews to tell Mia that her father (who she hasn\\'t seen since she was tiny) was actually royalty and that she, Mia, was princess of a country no one\\'s ever heard of. What it comes down to is this: She has until a big embassy ball to decide whether she wants to give up the crown (and basically open the country up to a hostile political takeover) or take her place as princess. After a makeover (at the hands of funnyman Larry Miller), some training and at least four horrendously traumatizing incidents, she decides...well, that would be giving it away, wouldn\\'t it?This is not a movie for little girls dressed in tutus who want to be princesses when they grow up. For the first time in the studio\\'s tenure (I\\'d wager) this film depicts the responsibility of royalty. Mia tackles with the pressures of ruling a country. But for my money the best part of this movie is the love story. No, not Mia and the uniquely attractive rocker (although, that is great). A second, unscripted love story exists between Andrews and her chauffeur, Hector Elizondo. That\\'s terrific.It\\'s about being yourself and bettering yourself. It\\'s about knowing who your real friends are. It\\'s about living up to your own expectations. It\\'s about smushing an ice cream cone on the blouse of a bitchy cheerleader who deserves it. And maybe that sounds corny to all y\\'all (rustic expression) but I know a lot of adults who could use lessons like these.',\n",
       " \"This movie is my ultimate guilty pleasure. It's inane, manipulative, has hyperactive cutting, a ton of glaring inaccuracies (pointless to even discuss or debate), and probably 29 other glaring faults. And why in every dramatic slow-mo emo shot are there 3 helicopters flying in unison overhead? What's the point of having 3 helicopters flying really close together? Who cares! It looks cool. If one day I am having a heartfelt talk with my daughter, I hope there are 3 helicopters flying overhead to really 'bring it home' (and Aerosmith performing in the background.)Despite it all, I still love watching this movie. Anytime it is on TV I can watch it 'til the end. Bruce Willis does a great job doing his Bruce Willis 'thing' (smart alecky tough guy), and the supporting cast is really great. Steve Buschemi in particular gets the best lines. An awesome assortment of ragtag castoffs (spitting funny one-liners) must save the world- who would have thunk it?I think Armageddon was actually conceived by suits in a studio office (no really, I read that in a magazine), which is I guess another strike against it. Yet only a bunch of suits could come up with a 'high concept' like this (so high it's basically a parody by itself.) And only a director like Michael Bay could make it. He's far more suited to these types of movies, rather than big historical epics like PEARL HARBOR (which I really, really disliked.)I read somewhere once that this movie is as close as Hollywood gets to pure cinema, in that it is basically completely divorced from reality of any kind. Is that good or bad? I don't know. I do think if you're going to ditch convention and any semblance to reality, you may as well go all the way. It's better than having something that is a confused mess that tries to be different things (Pearl Harbor.) There will be no 'it could really happen!' here.So after all this, believe it or not I am going to give this movie a big fat whopping 8. Why? Because IMO it unabashedly succeeds at what it tries to set out to be, whatever that is. That makes no sense, since I am basically saying by all logical accounts this movie may actually suck, yet I am giving it a 8. But hey I loved this movie.\",\n",

Never at any point did this film make drugs look at all appealing to me in any way, I never did understand why so many people thought that it did.

Since the revolutionary classic first film, Fox/hollywood have made 4 sequels all of which I have thoroughly enjoyed/ still critiqued. A perfect sequel hasn't been made imo and may never be, but I can say this new film has the closest effective wilderness ambience/suspense to the first film and that warrants great praise.I was skeptical with a few things judging by the trailer but seeing the final product I can say that no matter the logic holes in the mismatch of Pred vs prey , the film is executed quite well. The settings are phenomenal and amplify the overall product. Dan Trachtenberg has a keen eye for detail as seen in 10 cloverfield lane and shows it once again. The costume design captures a completely different timeframe awesomely as well as shows a new more prehistoric predator that might be the coolest visually yet. Music and sound is crisp and powerful and adds so much. The acting is bare bones but for the story it has to be as far as context.It's a shame that this had to be only streaming as it should have been in theater. The scenery is fantastic. But regardless it's a surprising return to roots as far as the back to basics setting and suspense aspects. It's another welcome sequel and should be seen by any predator fan or action fan.\",\n",

I think what bothers me the most is that a lot of the writing is just lazy and not well thought through or truely creative. Instead we get more of the same themes from the original JP films plus some more from JW. (Mutant dinosaur + evil corporate guys)All of the main characters stories are pretty unbelievable and there isn't enough investment in developing their individual personalities / backstory so we understand why they behave the way they do. Sometimes I feel like the major action scenes were thought up first and then the story was just sort of inserted between them as a glue so we have a way of getting from one action scene to the next.If you go and see this film you will probably enjoy it and it will most certainly entertain you for a while but after the moment has passed I am not left with the sense that I have seen something truely groundbreaking. Unfortunately I can't help but compare it to the original Jurassic park film and consider how it doesn't even come close to the terrifying moments of suspence and the brilliant portrayal of the different characters we got in JP1.Given that there are so many 9+ reviews on here maybe i am in the minority but I just feel like we are letting Hollywood get away with lazy writing, which contains numerous plot holes just so we can marvel at some cool CGI. We really should'nt be satisfied with this state of affairs. We should all be demanding better, more creative writing that continues to offer us something new and exciting. This will only happen if we stop rating these mediocre generic blockbuster films so highly. Was it was entertaining? yes without a doubt, but this is nowhere near a 9/10 film and you all know it. When rating these films please be honest with yourselves and send Hollywood a message. Don't let them think that lazy writing is ok. We aren't idiots and we do value a well written and interesting story.\",\n",

Quite literally one of the quintessential titles in tbe genre, so, I was honestly very terrified about this new movie coming out, especially after David Gordon Green's downfall with Halloween Ends. Having seen the movie now, I'm not sure how the general public will feel about this film, and responses I've been seeing have been pretty divisive. With that being said, I thought this movie was very good and was not at all offensive to the original 1973 classic. Specifically, the final 10 minutes of the film were filled with so much adrenaline, and they so something very ballsy in the end!!

       " 'The answer to the obvious question hovering around Jon Favreau\\'s latest action blockbuster is yes, \"Cowboys & Aliens\" is as ridiculous as the title sounds. Yet blame doesn\\'t quite belong on Favreau\\'s shoulders or that of star Daniel Craig or the rest of the cast; rather, the failure of this alien-infested Western results from the domino effect of the countless studios and producers who put their faith (and money) in a concept rather than a story.To be fair, I know nothing of the Platinum Studios comic by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, but it couldn\\'t have been all that good if all the hottest screenwriters in Hollywood couldn\\'t whip together a plot worth a damn. The duos behind \"Iron Man\" and \"Star Trek\" along with \"Lost\" writer Damon Lindelof all took cracks at the screenplay and an earlier treatment from another pair of \"it\" writers who wrote next month\\'s \"Conan the Barbarian\" was discarded. Frankly, criticism of \"Cowboys & Aliens\" all stems from a story with lackluster characters equipped with cliché motivations. Despite some cool aliens, the action doesn\\'t offer anything unique enough to counter that we\\'ve no reason to care.Craig stars as Jake Lonergan, a stoic outlaw in Arizona sometime in the late 19th Century who wakes up with no memory and some metal device on his wrist. When he arrives in the town of Absolution, the sheriff discovers he\\'s wanted and attempts to ship him off for a reward. That\\'s when the aliens attack, bombing the town and roping up locals before flying off into the night. Lonergan\\'s bracelet activates as a weapon and suddenly he\\'s the only one capable of defeating these things. He joins a rescue party led by a grumpy Civil War vet named Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) and they all set off to find out what happened to their loved ones.The script introduces characters willy-nilly and provides little satisfactory explanation for anything that happens. The story paints Lonergan as a quiet badass, but one who has flashes of some woman he loved. Because his past slowly unravels with nothing revelatory to show for it as the film wears on, it\\'s tough to care much or even see him as capable of romantic feelings. Regardless, a woman named Ella (Olivia Wilde) keeps approaching him with questions he doesn\\'t have the answers to and she evolves into a love interest for nothing but the sake of it. Sam Rockwell has little to no bearing on the film other than serving an example of an otherwise peaceful man who will do whatever it takes to get his wife back. He\\'s a waste in the role. As for Ford, he just gets on screen and acts grumpy and impatient. We\\'ve seen everyone on board do so much better. Did these folks not read the script? Probably not considering the number of drafts alone.Worst of all, the script thinks we will care; after all, this is \"Cowboys & Frickin\\' Aliens!\" In the final sequence, suddenly all these supporting characters have little moments together out of seemingly thin air. What are supposed to be moments in the story tying up relationship subplots between characters end up as reminders that these relationships and subplots even existed in the first place. Consequently, the film\\'s pivotal moments result not in hearts beating, but eyes rolling.In fairness, Favreau shows his adeptness from an action perspective once again in this film. The movie looks good if nothing else with strong visual effects and a strong concept team behind the aliens and related technology. The genre experiment generally works from a tonal perspective, an obstacle that certainly stood in Favreau\\'s path. The film feels like a Western and one in which aliens could feasibly exist, so no problems due to identity crisis.Yet the film never provides a single reason to justify why it had to be a story about cowboys and aliens. In that sense, the movie results in nothing more than several studios and producers thinking we\\'d simply be interested in a fusion of a shoot-em-up Western with an alien invasion. All involved failed to ask the one critical question when making a film based on a concept: \"is there a good story here?\" No, there\\'s not. Despite every ounce of you wanting to find a reason to care about what happens, none arrives. As such, \"Cowboys & Aliens\" offers watchable but lifeless entertainment.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com',\n",
       " \"I think this is possibly Miyazaki's most intriguing movie. All of his other films are very linear and even though their highly varied worlds may be visually stunning and highly creative, I feel the dreamy world of Howls Moving Castle is by far the most captivating, bizarre, and imaginative of all the worlds Miyazaki has ever envisioned.What I love about this movie is that it's highly emotional without a great deal of logic or plot or story to get in the way. In this way the film is simple, pure, and extremely beautiful. It is as if the characters go from one emotion to the next, in a world that is as random as one's own dreams. Some people have complained about the lack of plot or story or serious character development, but even though the characters are fairly static, their emotions and the physical changes they undergo as they go through these emotions brings out a higher truth that is seldom given such artistic and natural freedom.I think this is a very smart movie in many subtle ways and it's one that I look forward to watching again on the big screen and then on DVD. Although it flirts from theme to theme to theme with a kind of animated attention deficit disorder, the landscapes and utter unabated surrealism left me stunned and never bored.Also, from a quizzical character design perspective, Howl is certainly one of if not the most beautiful characters that Miyazaki has ever created. Howl is an interesting departure from Miyazaki's more classical wabi-sabi anime style that most of his heroes and heroines are drawn in as Howl is definitely a very contemporary bishonen.If you're looking for quaint settings, dynamic characters and a very involving character or plot driven story, you're not going to necessarily find them here, but you will find an equally stunning and pleasing movie if you let yourself go and enjoy this passionate, heartfelt and surreal Miyazaki dream.\",\n",
       " \"All these 1s and 2s are ridiculous. I gave it an 8 rating just to bring the average up, because I'd hate for anyone to miss out on the fun due to the poor average rating. This movie was just fun, silly, and over the top action. I think a lot of people take movie watching way too seriously. But sometimes you just want to watch something that doesn't challenge your mind in any way, but just provides relaxation and fun.I had no expectations of a great film, just the hope of entertainment, and that's exactly what I got. The cast was perfect, the story was formulaic but fun, and the whole thing was like an amusement park ride.\",\n",
       " \"Watching this movie directed by Pushkar Oza and Sagar Ambre was not just a disappointment, but an outright insult to the art of filmmaking. It's a mind-numbing exercise in tedium, where every minute feels like an eternity of wasted potential. The screenplay is so devoid of life and creativity that it's as if the writers were actively trying to drain any semblance of entertainment from the film.The dialogue, if you can even call it that, is a cringe-inducing parade of clichés and tired tropes that belong in the bargain bin of forgotten B-movies. It's painfully obvious that the duo directors have yet to grasp even the most basic principles of compelling storytelling. They seem content to rely on the crutch of big-name actors and a bloated production budget, mistakenly believing that flashy visuals and famous faces can compensate for a lack of substance.But alas, no amount of star power or expensive set pieces can salvage this sinking ship of a film. It's a cinematic catastrophe of epic proportions, a slap in the face to anyone who values their time and intelligence. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of this train wreck unless, masochistically, you derive pleasure from subjecting yourself to two hours of soul-crushing mediocrity.This is what happens when the producers not only bet on the inferior horses, but also hand them blinders and expect them to win the race. It's a disgraceful display of incompetence that tarnishes the reputation of everyone involved, leaving a stain on the industry that may never wash away.\",\n",

And my time (finally out of the house, with my fiancé. Great date. NAHT.) From the outrageously racist jokes, the fat jokes, the stereotypical comic reliefs, the utterly pointless scenes and unbelievably unrealistic characters - Just the worst.

It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.\\nI was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations. Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.\",\n",

The characters are as charming as the cast that speaks for them.It's a learning experience children get to see how an industry works. Monsters, Inc. is an in-genius corporation that has scientifically learned how to channel children's screams into energy that is used for electrical power.  It has monster employees, an assembly line of doors (which give monsters access to children's bedrooms), a top-flight training program and some of the top Monsters in the scaring business.There's a colorful Metropolis, filled with houses, buildings, businesses, cars and everything that makes a city run smoothly along with a population of colorful creatures.  One of the colorful groups of creatures is the yellow swat team.  Their job is to protect the Metropolis of Monsters, Inc. from human contamination.But what happens when a human child mysteriously gets through the bedroom door and terrorizes the city with screams and boo's.  It's wondrous and funny.  In the mist of all this is industrial crime, brought on by greed. But, the story ends on a very happy note.John Goodman is the voice of `Sulley' a colorful large blue-green ape like monster who's the star Monsters, Inc. employee.  He's some type of monster, cut, cuddly, and he has a conscience that leads him to feelings of regret about scarring children.  He becomes attached to Boo (voice of Mary Gibbs) a cute, little big-eyed girl who is mysteriously brought to Monsters, Inc. and in his quest to return her home becomes very attached to her.Sulley's best friend is Mike (voice of Billy Crystal) who's a funny looking green ball with stick legs and one huge eye.  His comedy is seen through out the movie.  Mike is Sulley's driving force, acting as his agent.  Mike's job is to make sure Sulley remains the top Monsters, Inc. employee.

A perfectly pleasant, oh-so-normal guy, played effortlessly by Blake Jenner, is our viewpoint as he befriends a bunch of caricatured late adolescents. Mr Normal is not even a thinly disguised version of the writer/director, who evidently saw his younger self as a beacon of sanity in the midst of all that hormone-fuelled excess.The worst part of it is that Linklater has talent as a filmmaker. The piece is competently constructed and shot, and contains a couple of well-written scenes, notably a split-screen phone conversation between Jenner and the movie's only other credible character, played without affectation by Zoey Deutsch.

       " \"With at least 12 `starring actors' in character and supporting rolls, half of them legends or mega stars; this Tarantino tale defies a short review.  The different levels on which this movie works are impressive. As a love story we begin to believe that the quirky `loser' couple is unconditionally bound together.  As a pseudo `film noir' we begin to care about the fate of the central characters.  In the suspense/thriller/crime drama mode there are plenty twists and turns to push us to the edge and pull us back just in time.  The action scenes are deliciously violent and unlike most other films, this one gives us pinches of humor sprinkled in amidst the mayhem.   Even `the King' alter ego is woven in credibly enough to improve our understanding of the Clarence Worley character.The plot, albeit original, fresh and mesmerizing, seems somehow secondary to the characters and the characterizations.  Any of several rolls could have been performed over the top by what seemed to be an ensemble cast. But director Scott lets the talent go just far enough. Even the remainder of the supporting cast is wonderful; Saul Rubinek in particular does a terrific job as the puffed-up/ego-feeding movie producer.  Hollywood missed giving this movie and its cast proper recognition.With enough memorable scenes and talented stars to fuel a half a dozen blockbusters, True Romance gives us the `best bang for our buck' in years. The Walken/Hopper scene alone is worth the `price of admission' not to mention the Gandolfini/Arquette and Slater/Oldman match ups.  This can only be described as a `wonderfully wicked movie' for its tantalizing content, smart dialog and toothsome violence.Put the kiddies to bed, be prepared for rough language, adult themes and graphic violence and enjoy a `not for the faint of heart' masterpiece.\",\n",

I couldn't detect their soul or any evidence of its existence. In a way they represent the worst of the previous generations. Roman Emperors or Wall Street. Profit is the name of the game and the ideas come out of boredom of longings to get laid. Love and friendship, loyalty and/or honor as obsolete as good manners. Jesse Eisenberg is chillingly perfect as the humanoid that started it all - or did he? - Justin Timberlake keeps surprising me.

       " \"I have a theory that this movie has probably been seen by more people than any other movie. The fact that it comes to us as children is probably the reason why. Other films like 'Gone With the Wind', 'Citizen Kane', 'The Godfather', 'Star Wars', have been seen by a lot of people but in each case I can imagine people that might not have seen them. In the case of 'The Wizard of Oz' it's hard to imagine anyone who might not have seen it at some point in their lives. Almost everyone you talk to has a memory of their first experience. The reason this movie remains the most beloved of Hollywood films even after six decades is because 'The Wizard of Oz' is unique among motion pictures in that it mirrors our longings and imaginations as children. The movie, in front of and behind the scenes, has become movie folklore. We love the legends about the rotating directors, from George Cukor to King Vidor to Victor Fleming. We know the legend of Buddy Ebsen who had to drop out due to an allergic reaction to the Tin Man makeup and Margaret Hamilton whose dress caught fire and nearly had her face burned off because of the copper-based make-up. We love stories about the problems on the set between personal feuds, sweltering costumes, partying munchkins and the costume designer who had to keep up with Judy Garland's developing bust line. There's even a spurious legend of a ghost on the set. All of these elements make 'The Wizard of Oz' a much bigger legend than it already it, but that's okay because this is the one movie that deserves to be over-hyped. It occupies such a large part of our memories that we want to make it more than it is, to just have one more reason to make it more than a movie, we want it to be a life experience.That experience is brought to us because we are intimately familiar with its story elements. The dreams that Dorothy sings about and the adventure that follows seem to mirror our yearnings as children. She imagines a bigger place where her problems don't linger and she is free to explore them. She imagines a place where there isn't any trouble and people actually listen to what she has to say. She sees the rainbow as her golden gate to a better place because in her drab Kansas world, the rainbow is the only source of color that she knows. She dreams of a bigger place and imagines a world where troubles melt like lemondrops. We can relate. How many of us as kids sat in our room or in our yards and played, imagining a place to go and characters to interact with, a colorful world bigger than our small, confined worlds. Oz is meant to represent the colorful palette of our imagination but for Dorothy it is also a place where she does some growing up. The three friends that she meets along the way, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and The Lion are emblematic of the lessons of bravery, love and devotion and the ability to think for ourselves. The Wicked Witch of the West certainly represents the real dangers along the way. For Dorothy there is a matronly figure, Glinda the Good Witch who intends for Dorothy to discover for herself how to solve her problems, she knows that Dorothy must grow up along the way. In a way, she seems to represent the parent that Dorothy doesn't have back in Kansas. Her aunt and uncle love her but this was a movie made during the depression and we imagine the climate that they live in, where work means keeping the farm. No work = no farm = no home.For 1939, Dorothy was the perfect character for young girls. She echoes many of the small town country girls who, in the midst of the depression, packed their suitcases and ran to Hollywood seeking fame and fortune in the movies. For them this film is a cautionary tale that they'd be better off if they just stayed home. Judy Garland was perfect in the role, 17 at the time, but with wide-eyes and a beautiful, open face she carries that sense of wonderment of a child. Like most of us as children, her only true companion is a dog named Toto and the most frightening moment in the film is when she is nearly robbed of her best friend. When she sings 'Over the Rainbow' we know that it's to escape an unhappy childhood (she has apparently lost her parents) and for Garland we identify. She began in show business as a kiddie act with her sisters and began her long movie career when she was only 13. She was already a familiar face from 'Love Finds Andy Hardy' and by the time of 'Oz' she was already under contract to MGM. That she was familiar to audiences helped her in the role. That familiarity works well with her ability to project the vulnerability and melancholy that the character has to have. We have to believe that she will become frightened and that her life will be in danger because if she doesn't that we sense that the character can work her way out of the situation herself and our interest wanes.If movies are a time capsule than 'The Wizard of Oz' wonderfully captures a brief moment of happiness in Garland's life. We know of her problems with studio execs that put her through an exhausting schedule and used drugs to get her going in the morning then put her to sleep at night. We know the legends of her mental and physical problems that dogged her most of her life but 'The Wizard of Oz' sees her at a moment in her life when it all seemed perfect, just as her star was rising and before her problems really began. There's poignancy in that, and that's why I think that the casting of Shirley Temple in the role would have been a mistake. By 1939, Temple was the biggest star in the world her presence in the film would have been too much, she would have stood out and we would only seen Shirley Temple, not Dorothy Gale.Garland's presence allows the story a certain credibility. I have tried to imagine that famous dance down the Yellow Brick Road with a 4 foot child and it just doesn't fit.If Garland gives the film its center than I think the production design, awe-inspiring in 1939, is the perfect backdrop. In these early musicals filmed on a soundstage it isn't hard to spot where the soundstage ends. Some have seen that as a flaw but I think it adds to the dreamlike quality of the film. The matte paintings behind the sets add to the storybook quality. The fact that we're in a dream makes it okay that the special effects look a little hasty. That was the genius of the screenplay, that and to establish the Oz characters as characters that Dorothy meets in Kansas. In our dreams we often see people and events that have recently occurred in our lives, but this is the first time I've ever seen it expressed in a movie. In particular is the notion that Professor Marvel keeps showing up as various characters in the dream.What generosity the filmmakers had. What ingenuity to create this entire world that is colorful and beautiful and scary. What depth of character they created. What messages they send. This is a movie constructed with loving care. We're told that those who worked on the film just thought of this as just another movie, but when I watch the film I find that hard to believe. Certainly from the screenwriters. I wonder if they saw how brilliantly they were tapping our frustrations and our excitement, our dreams, our need and our sense of wonderment. I wonder if they knew the impact of what they were working on, that the lovely sentiments that they created would still resonate 60 years later. I wonder if they knew that their heart's desires weren't that far from our own.\",\n",

       " 'Finally got to see my most anticipated film of the year and I\\'m happy to tell you it\\'s everything I wished for and more. Flanagan has done an amazing job adapting the book from Stephen King and giving lovers of the Kubrick film adaptation of \"The Shining\" (1980) a cinematic sequel.\\nNow i read the book and while I enjoyed it for the most part, I found parts of it underwhelming. I feel in this film adaptation, Flanagan takes elements from the novel and manages to make them more darker and serious which in turn really helped address some issues I had with the book. He does make some serious changes though and while I embraced them I\\'m not sure how others who read the book will feel about them. \"The Shining\" (1980) to me and I\\'m sure a lot of you, is a masterpiece in filmmaking. I for one prefer it over the novel and with this film, it most certainly feels like a sequel to Stanley Kubrick\\'s version and a love letter to that film. The last 30 mins or so are absolutely amazing and kudos to Flanagan for pulling it off.\\nEwan McGregor does a great job as an adult Danny Torrance and Rebecca Ferguson captivates as Rose the Hat. The film sets a great tone with some stunning visuals and the score completely grabs you. How much you enjoy this film really depends on what you want out of it. There\\'s practically no gore here and no cheap jump scares.

       " 'This movie is not so much about aliens who are hiding among us, but instead it taps into the deeply submerged suspicion held by most of us that we are being manipulated and taken advantage of by the elite of American society, by our leaders, by the rich, etc. Also, we sometimes feel that we are manipulated and programmed (in a subtle way) to respect hierarchical authority ( e.g., the \"OBEY\" subliminal command from the movie). Some leftist thinkers might say that human societies are in a way being parasitized by the elite of their societies, and that the elite operate as a parasitic sub-society, living off of the lower classes. America might be said to be operated more in such a fashion (i.e., parasitized by the elite) than are the countries of western Europe. Obvious examples of this parasitic behavior are the \"golden handshakes\" and backscratching exchanged between corporate CEO\\'s and the Boards of Directors of their companies. But it is far more pervasive than just that._They_Live_ uses the invisible alien elite as a proxy for our suspicions about how we are all being exploited by the elite of our real-life society, and how these elite are subtly programming us to accept this exploitation.So, the major theme of the movie is not, as another poster correctly pointed out, about being manipulated to be good little consumers in a crassly commercial world. No, it is far more profound than that. Instead, it is more about how the working class Americans in _They Live_ are being exploited by the elite upper crust, who, in the movie, happen to be aliens, but who, in the real world, are a subsociety that use their collective power to exploit the rest of us.Unfortunately, this movie sometimes has an unintentionally comic air to it. Still, the exploration of that theme is so rare in pop culture, and that theme is so profound, and reaches so far into what American society is, was, and is becoming, that this movie is a Must-See for anyone with an interest in politics and sociology.',\n",

After waiting in line for 3 hours after last night\\'s Comic-Con and finally being sat in the gorgeous Balboa Theater, I didn\\'t know what to expect. I loved the comics and the previews looked faithful. The moment the movie starts (literally; the Universal logo and theme are 8-bit) you are thrown into a comic book atmosphere with video game references aplenty.The plot revolves around Scott Pilgrim needing to defeat the 7 Evil Exes of Ramona Flowers in order to date her and it is a harrowing sequence of battles. Each fight is crazier than the last and some are used purely for comedy, not excitement. Almost every other line is a punchline and they all work. References to TV shows, video games and comics (just like a 20-something\\'s life would include) are everywhere and if you accept the concept of the plot, it all feels natural.While the audience might\\'ve been biased (we held a 10-minute standing ovation for Edgar Wright when the movie finished) there\\'s no denying that it\\'s an excellent film. Edgar Wright has an uncanny sense of comic timing with edits and sound cues to make the picture tight and focused when it\\'s looking for laughs.I can\\'t imagine a mainstream theater erupting in applause and laughter like ours did but make no mistake; this a crowd pleaser and the MOST enjoyable film I\\'ve seen in years.

       " \"After my third viewing, I can finally admit that this film has me. I enjoyed it during its theatrical run, enjoyed it more the second time around, and now, I can only say that I love it. The cast is exemplary. Tom Cruise is so good in this film that it is very often easy to forget he is Tom Cruise. Easily his most powerful role and best performance since Jerry Maguire. Ken Watanabe, however, is incredible in every scene - acting with a rare sensitivity and intensity and breathing life into a character much larger and more human than the grand story of which he is a part. Though the entire cast is excellent, I feel that I must also single out Koyuki and Shichinosuke Nakamura for, respectively, the female lead and the emperor, for the subtle strength and believability they each give their very challenging roles.The story takes place during the early modernization of Japan, in the 1870s and 1880s. The Emperor's power has been weakened by the political and economic power of his cabinet, by his young age, and by the political influence of the United States and other western powers pulling the strings of his cabinet and supplying modern weaponry and tactics to the modernizing Japanese army. Cruise plays Captain Allgren, an alcoholic veteran who has seen and participated in too many massacres of innocent people, and is offered an opportunity to reclaim some of his honor by helping to train the Japanese military in the use of firearms. When he arrives in Japan, we learn that the first test of the Japanese army and its new weapons will be against a rebellious group of samurai who believe themselves to be in the service of the Emperor and Japan, but resist the Emperor's cabinet and the influence of western nations. In the power void left by a passive emperor, Japan seems poised to enter into a civil war against its own values, faith and honor. During the first attack on the Samurai, Allgren is captured by the Samurai and begins a spiritual, physical and philosophical journey which will bring him a level of self-respect his own culture could never supply.My interpretation of this journey is that Allgren has found a place and people that offer him redemption, where, in his own world, he can find none. But Allgren's is only a small part of the story - which ultimately revolves around what is right for Japan, for the subjectivity of a whole nation, and how to portray such a subject from its own perspective. Traditional Japan is treated with empathy here, not aggrandizing exaggeration, as some of the film's critics seem to suggest. This is not a film about what is objectively right and wrong, but a film about struggling to understand and empower tradition as a means to control and benefit from change. I find no grand moral statement here, but rather an intense, sympathetic, human drama with a strong sense of honor and sacrifice.Edward Zwick has made a film which operates well at every level, carrying simple but profound philosophical ideas, but avoiding the mistake of making these ideas and the characters that express them super-heroic. Ultimately, this beautifully shot film conveys powerful messages about war, tradition, ethics, honor and culture, which, though not particularly original, are sensitively and intelligently brought forward. There is a lot of action, including some remarkably well-acted sword fighting and martial artistry, but none of it seems unnecessary and the whole film is truly tightly woven. My highest recommendation.\",\n",
       " 'Greetings again from the darkness. My \\'old school\\' nature causes me to cringe at the thought of classic films being remade. Why mess with something that\\'s already beloved? However, since we know this happens (and will continue to happen), let\\'s at least breathe a sigh of relief that a true lover of cinema and one of our legendary filmmakers, Steven Spielberg, is responsible for this one. Teaming once again with screenwriter Tony Kushner (MUNICH, LINCOLN), the love and admiration of the 1957 stage production, its music, and the 1961 film (by Robert Wise) shine through in this beautiful presentation. It\\'s Spielberg\\'s 35th movie, yet it\\'s his first musical. You will note a few changes from the stage production and 60 year old movie, but the timing of a couple of songs, more realistic brawling, and additional on-location scenes all blend seamlessly into this lovely version.Kushner\\'s adaption of Arthur Laurents\\' original work contributes to the contemporary, yet nostalgic feeling. It maintains the \"Romeo and Juliet\" story of star-crossed lovers at the core of a turf battle between the Sharks (Puerto Ricans) and Jets (white immigrants), which is driven by a prejudice stirring the hatred that leads to conflict. Sound familiar? It could be taken from the local news headlines just about any day over the past few years. What also hasn\\'t changed is that the Sharks and Jets are so blinded by hate and pride that they can\\'t see how much they have in common, with the same loss looming. In fact, the point is driven home in the film\\'s opening. Cinematographer and two-time Oscar winner Janusz Kaminski (SCHINDLER\\'S LIST, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) has his camera soaring and swooping to show us the neighborhood and ongoing demolition before zeroing in on a sign \"Property Purchased by New York City for Slum Clearance\". It comes in like a wrecking ball (literally). The two factions are fighting over turf that will soon be transitioned to Lincoln Center and high dollar real estate.Ansel Elgort stars as Tony, the former leader of the Jets attempting to find a new path for his life after spending a year in prison for nearly killing an Egyptian immigrant in a rumble. Rachel Zegler, in a remarkable silver screen debut, stars as Maria, a bright-eyed Puerto Rican who sees the upside to limitless opportunity. Early on, we get our first conflict between the rival gangs, which introduces us to Riff (a terrific Mike Faist) as the quick-tempered Jets leader so desperate to protect the neighborhood, and Bernardo (a dynamic David Alvarez), Maria\\'s older brother and proud leader of the Sharks - whose goal is to carve out a place in the new land as equal citizens. That first brawl gives Spielberg a chance to show off the choreography, as well as the new approach to fight scenes, which are less balletic and more bone-crunching. It\\'s also the first run-in with local cops, Officer Krupke (Brian d\\'arcy James) and Lt. Schrank (Corey Stoll), neither of whom have much empathy or respect for the two gangs.Tony (Ansel Elgort has a physical resemblance to Richard Beymer from the original film) and Maria get their \\'eyes lock across the gymnasium during the dance\\' moment that really lights the candle for the big rumble. Of course, this is one of the most famous musicals of all-time, and the songs have become iconic. Elgort is handsome and has a smooth singing voice, but it\\'s Ms. Zegler whose voice transcends and sounds heaven sent. If there is a negative, it\\'s that no one will be able to sing along with her, as she hits notes most can only dream of. Listening to her sing is reward enough. Beyond the singing, it\\'s the dance choreography that most recall, and although eclipsing what we saw in the original movie is beyond reach, the work of this cast will not likely disappoint anyone. The dance numbers are exhilarating and colorful. It\\'s energized entertainment with a message.Ariana DeBose is outstanding as Anita, and takes the lead on \"America\", one of the most inspiring and fun musical numbers ever on screen. In addition to her singing and dancing, Ms. DeBose delivers a superb performance in the role that won an historic Oscar for Rita Moreno in the 1961 film. Sixty years later, the now 89 year old Ms. Moreno appears as Valentina, the widow of Doc. She now runs Doc\\'s Drug Store and is acting as surrogate mother to Tony. It\\'s certainly no cameo, and though Ms. Moreno doesn\\'t have a dance number, she does get to sing \"Somewhere\", and this time is on the heroic end of the rape scene. She is the connective fiber to the original film and delivers a heart-warming performance, and is a strong presence where needed.Other key supporting roles are Chino, Maria\\'s would-be suitor, played by Josh Andres Rivera, and \\'Anybodys\\', played by Iris Menas in a non-binary rather than tomboyish portrayal of the one skulking in the shadows. It\\'s no surprise that Riff and Bernardo and Anita are the heftiest roles, and all three actors nail their parts. The big (and pleasant) surprises are newcomer and future star Rachel Zegler and the return of Ms. Moreno. Zegler sings \"I Feel Pretty\" while working the cleaning crew at Gimbel\\'s, and her divine sweetness gets blown away in the finale, exhibiting an acting range that complements that voice.The always stunning score from composer Leonard Bernstein sounds amazing as performed by the New York Philharmonic, and much of original choreographer Jerome Robbins\\' work is reproduced here. It\\'s unfortunate that renowned lyricist Stephen Sondheim passed away mere days before the premiere, but his work lives on through new voices. \"Tonight\" and \"Cool\" both receive fresh treatments and are standouts in this version. The 1961 film won 10 Oscars, including Best Picture, and there is little doubt this remake will receive consideration in numerous categories, including Production Design and Costume Design. Spielberg opted to go with a more ethnically appropriate cast (no Natalie Wood-type in heavy make-up), and there is some Spanish dialogue without subtitles (the acting and situation keep us clear). It\\'s a nostalgic, yet contemporary version that may not have you singing, \"Krup You!\", but will have you in awe with the story, dancing, music, acting, and story.Opening in theaters on December 10, 2021.',\n",
       " \"BILLY & MOLLY is an enthralling documentary about the unlike relationship between a retired older man who is living in retirement the lower half of the Arctic of the Shetland Islands, who is out in his boat one day and comes across a young orphaned river otter. Within days, Billy finds the hungry, out-of-her depth river otter who is out of her depth in the larger Shetland Islands and the rough sea water nearby. He begins to feed her and a bond ensues. Narrated by Billy & his wife, we see the Molly as she comes of age and learn to depend on Billy. Molly has tapped into a source of profound emotional attachment for this enchanting creature. He eventually builds Molly a house. Then one day, a male Otter comes calling and Molly disappears. Somewhat dismayed Billy learns to accept her disappearance, until one day she returns and in need of some fatherly support. There is never a false step in this emotionally involving documentary, which shows three distinct species interacting, all of them emotionally stirring. Molly is a compellingly sweet-natured creature, playful, charming, and Billy becomes the father he never quite managed to be in life. This is story shows how we connect deeply with the creatures that we encounter in life. Molly is pure joy and you can see the profound affect she has on Billy's life. But Billy's generosity is compelling, as is his wife's. You will not soon forget this lovely film. Kudos to National Geographic and their partners for creating something so pure and and heart-expanding.\",\n",
       " 'First off, it\\'s not like the pain killer shows from Netflix and Hulu, different drug. Secondly, I don\\'t understand why people are hating on the movie. Story line is great, acting is great and it\\'s an interesting story based on true events. Not sure what else you really need in a film to make it at a bare minimum enjoyable.Saw a review said \"it\\'s not cool for a kid to start a forest fire.\" As that statement is true, the movie didn\\'t make it cool n it\\'s literally 7seconds of the film. Or someone else was comparing it to a Scorsese film? Lol I guess having music and interesting story makes that true? People are so sensitive and just can\\'t enjoy a movie.',\n",

Too many people expected full comic book accuracy with Taskmaster, which would have been hard to accomplish and harder to fit in the story they were trying to tell. I understand the disappointment from fans who expected that full Taskmaster story, but do not think it means that this movie was a flop. Florence Pugh was excellent in the film and the chemistry between her and Scarlett Johansson was great. Good fighting sequences except for parts of the third act where the CGI was very noticeable. Plus that end credit scene was amazing. One of my only complaints is that Marvel stated you wouldn't need to watch the shows to understand the movies but if you hadn't seen falcon and the winter solider the end credits may not make a 100 percent sense. At least make it clear the shows are a must watch if you are going to make them necessary to understand certain things. Overall a great movie.\",\n",

That's My Boy is the funniest Adam Sandler movie and in my opinion the funniest movie I've ever seen. I did not go longer than 5 minutes without hysterically laughing at the scenes in this movie. As a fan of movies such as Wedding Crashers, Old School, Step Brothers, 21 Jump Street, Superbad, and Forgetting Sarah Marshall just to name a few, this has to be the funniest movie out of the bunch. If you're looking for more than just laughs, than maybe the movie might not be right for you. And do not go into an R rated comedy expecting no dirty jokes.

       " 'It\\'s hard to explain what this movie means to me. Words could never. I remember when I was a kid, I never liked the first Rocky, was too obsessed with III and IV. It happened when I was 11 and I went to see V in the theater. I never been to a movie like that before. People were screaming and cheering. Shook the whole damn place. They were dancing in the isle\\'s and celebrating. It was then I realized the true power of Stallone\\'s vision. The realization that only the original would ever really matter.Rocky to me is so many things. I had to beg my girlfriend to see it. She said she doesn\\'t like boxing. I almost dumped her right there. If she wasn\\'t so hot, I probably would have. I was crushed that someone could think that this movie is about boxing. To me it was never that. It\\'s about a guy, much like you or me, who\\'s down on his luck and everyday feels like Sunday. He\\'s pushing 30, single and broke. I\\'m sad to say that at this moment it almost reminds me of myself. Every minute more another reason. It\\'s hard to pick my favorite scenes from the movie. I love the chemistry between Rocky and Adrian (Shire). When he\\'s talking to door and she finally comes out and then stops to look in the mirror. It\\'s a thing of beauty. Or when Mickey (Meredith) goes over to Stallones apartment. Rocky gets upset and punches his shitty wall, then goes to hide in the bathroom. The look on Stallone\\'s face when he comes out to find Mickey still there is priceless. I heard it wasn\\'t in the script or directed, just happened. But the one that does it for me is when he comes home in the opening scene after the chapel fight. He turns on his record player and goes for a beer, but it\\'s empty, like everything else in his life. Talks to the turtles and his fish, why because the Rock is lonely. Goes to the mirror and practices a joke for his love. Looks at a picture of himself and realizes he\\'s wasting his life. It\\'s more than beautiful or real.It\\'s safe to say that I have seen the original more than 100 times. I still feel all the emotion. I love this movie more than any other film. I hope one day, with God\\'s help, to show it to my kids and have them feel the same way. I think if I ever got the chance to meet Stallone, I\\'d want to thank him. Tell him how he changed my life. But in reality, he probably wouldn\\'t care. Because, \"I\\'m at least half a bum.\"',\n",

She is hair-brained, and scatty, completely adorable and wonderful.The camera-work is gorgeous and the soundtrack is second to none.Lou (Emilia Clarke) gets a job as a carer to a man (William) who is paralyzed more or less from the neck down. A budding friendship/romance develops; and this is 90% a feel good movie.The criticism of the movie that it depicts a life with profound disability as almost worthless is completely mistaken. The movie depicts William's life as worthwhile and precious. It is William's own judgment that his life cannot go on as it is, and that he would prefer to die.With regard to this, the movie does tend to downplay the pain and suffering that William experiences. Instead it focuses on the good times and precious moments he spends will Lou. And as already stated, the character of Lou is completely adorable. I am in love.\",\n",
       " 'Note: I stay away from describing the plot in any detail because it would be very hard to do so without spoiling elements of it. \"Inside Man\" starts out as a no holds barred, high octane action-thriller, and by its midpoint fully transforms into a breezy, tongue-in-cheek heist movie, reminiscent of The Sting. I felt it to be a little over-plotted, but that comes with the genre - the expected twists and turns are all here, thankfully mostly in non-expected ways. Contrivances abound, and we don\\'t really learn the background of the heist (ie. how the robbers learned about their target) but the story and the overall atmosphere more than make up for this. The meticulously designed plot also compensates for the lack of real 3D characterization - save for Denzel Washington\\'s ambitious policeman hero, who at least achieves a level of humanity throughout the story. The character interaction between him and his sidekick (Chiwetel Ejiofor of \"Serenity\" fame) and the frustrated captain played by Willem Defoe is great with some sparkling dialog. Clive Owen is okay, most of the time convincing as the criminal mastermind, although he spends most of the film wearing a mask. I\\'d say this film is harmless fun, not your usual Spike Lee fare, which goes to prove his versatility. There is a hint in the back-story at some heavy issues of the past, but it\\'s nothing more than a macguffin that only achieves some slight significance in the resolution of the movie. There is a neat structural trickery in the use of flash-forward scenes, hinting toward the aftermath of the heist without giving away the real ending. It\\'s used sparingly and cleverly. I can highly recommend this movie, it is never boring for a moment, what\\'s more, I was enjoying it so much that as events were progressing toward the climax, I was wishing it would go on. And that\\'s very rare for me in the movies nowadays.',\n",
       " \"It seems based on many of the comments on this site that certain folks may be expecting a bit too much from a movie such as 'Napoleon Dynamite.'This ain't art cinema, folks. It's absurdist comedy. Don't go to see this film looking for deep meaning or well-constructed plot--the vague semblance of a plot is as artificial as they come, and seems inserted mostly to give the film structure and to permit the audience a somewhat 'happy' ending. NO, Napoleon Dynamite isn't about changing the world--it's live action 'South Park' (Preston, Idaho, where the film is set, actually bears a strong resemblance to the real South Park, Colorado). It's a highly ironic, self-mocking, merciless run of sight gags and one liners with no apparent purpose other than to get laughs at the expense of its main characters, especially the eponymous Napoleon, a fit stand-in for everyone who's ever felt like a socially inept outcast trapped in the hell of high school.This movie isn't for everybody, but if you don't see glimpses of your own childhood in the various awkwardnesses and failures of the main characters, you're in denial. Don't see Napoleon Dynamite if you're expecting sensitivity--go see it if you're pissed off at the world and just need to laugh. I saw it for the first time last night, and I'm still busting into spontaneous laughter whenever one of Napoleon's silly one-liners or blank-faced dead-pan non-sequitirs comes to mind.\",\n",

       " 'Given the vast majority of major criticisms levelled at this film, it would appear that a large percentage of the audience has completely missed the joke, or simply, didn\\'t find it at all amusing. With Death Proof (2007), Tarantino creates such a loving homage to a notoriously cult cinematic sub-culture that many people seem unaware of how to approach it or even how to appreciate the sheer fact that the film purposely goes out of its way to ape the style of late 60\\'s and early 70\\'s exploitation cinema in look, feel and content. The film isn\\'t meant to be taken entirely seriously, but rather, is a parody and/or pastiche of the kind of films that the vast majority of mainstream audiences simply wouldn\\'t want to see. I\\'m talking about films such as Two-Thousand Maniacs (1964), Ride the Whirlwind (1965), Manos: The Hands of Fate (1966), Satan\\'s Sadists (1968), The Big Bird Cage (1971), Boxcar Bertha (1972), Fight for Your Life (1977) or Satan\\'s Cheerleaders (1977); low-budget films made with often-non-professional actors, little in the way of conventional film logic, and highly controversial in terms of plot, theme and content.It also sets out to pastiche the \"grindhouse\" cinema phenomena, with the original idea of two films being shown as a double feature at drive-in movie theatres from state to state, with both films often being re-cut and re-edited, not by the filmmakers, but by the theatre owners themselves. This is evident in the amusing switch in title; with the film opening with the caption \\'Quentin Tarantino\\'s Thunderbolt\\', before awkwardly cutting to an obviously out of place title card with \\'Death Proof\\' crudely emblazoned across the screen. This is also the explanation for the purposeful mistakes in continuity, the sloppy editing and the switch between colour and black and white, as well as the façade of severely deteriorating film stock. It\\'s not sloppy film-making, but rather, a purposeful appropriation of sloppy film-making geared towards appealing to the kind of obsessive movie aficionado who gets the references and can appreciate the joke that Tarantino is attempting to pull.With this in mind, it seems hard to understand what people are complaining about. Do audiences actual expect this film to keep them enthralled and entertained when the vast majority of them would balk at experiencing many of the low-budget, semi-obscure films that influenced it? Hardly! The accusation here that \"nothing happens\" is fascicle. The fact that there is film running through the camera is proof enough that something is happening, with the hilariously bland dialog deconstructing the film in much the same way as the purposely amateurish composition, editing and sound all intended to fracture the cinematic language in the same way that Godard did; by reminding the audience that this is the film and the point of the film is to experience the sights and sounds that unfold before us. Added to this the colourful iconography, the music, the characters, the girls in tight t-shirts, the for once entirely justified performance from the man himself, all reminding us that this is a joyous, darkly comic romp in which the point is not \"why?\" but \"why not?\".The effect is reminiscent of Kill Bill (2003), which at times felt superficial or perhaps even too knowing for its own good, but still demonstrated to us the filmmaker\\'s great use of tone, texture, colour and movement, as well as turning many people on to a whole new world of cult Japanese cinema; from the works of highly individual filmmakers like Seijun Suzuki, Kinji Fukasaku and Takashi Miike, to cult performers like Sony Chiba. Death Proof attempts to do something similar with the likes of the American revisionist road movie, the B-cinema of Roger Corman and the femsploitation subgenre of films like The Big Bird Cage (1972), Caged Heat (1975), Day of the Woman (1978) and Ms. 45 (1981); a coolly ironic series of films in which wronged women take bloody revenge in an often elaborate and over the top style, chiefly intended to give a feminist slant to the still rampant degradation and misogyny prevalent in the exploitation genre.Other reference points are more obvious as they\\'re mentioned explicitly in the film; notably car chase cinema such as Vanishing Point (1971), Two-Lane Blacktop (1971), Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry (1974), Gone in 60 Seconds (1974) and even Spielberg\\'s Duel (1971). Some have complained that the film fails on account of its lack of action and emphasis on dialog and technique, but this seems churlish when you think of the films being referenced; with Vanishing Point featuring a number of cryptic, desert-set sequences in which characters talk and talk and talk, while Two-Lane Blacktop punctuates its scenes of hard driving and drag-racing with much in the way of meandering small-talk. Then we have the fact that films like Reservoir Dogs - which takes place almost entirely within a single setting - and Jackie Brown - which places emphasis entirely on character - use dialog to not only create the characters but to also tell the story.Regardless of this, Death Proof is meant as a piece of entertainment. There\\'s no real desire here for Tarantino to prove what kind of filmmaker he is because he\\'s already done that with the number of great films that came before. Sure, it can be seen as self-indulgent, but surely those of us familiar with the style of film-making being referenced here will revel in this particular kind of extravagance, loving everything from the continually inane female banter to the awesome scenes of high speed carnage. If you\\'re not a fan cult cinema or exploitation cinema or indeed a devotee of Tarantino\\'s work then this film really isn\\'t going to impress you. There\\'s no shame in that. Some films are made for a niche audience, destined to be a cult in their own right. However, for those who get it, Death Proof has the potential to be a truly exhilarating, one-off piece of film-making.',\n",

       " \"It's a bold statement but I stand by it. This movie had everything I wanted and a hell of a lot more. The plot in a nutshell is that a guy named David (Dan Stevens) goes to the house of a soldier who was KIA and claims to have known him personally, so the family invites him to stay. Then things start happening, secrets come out, and sh*t goes down. Simple premise, and if it sounds familiar it's probably because it's been done many times, but never quite with as much finesse as The Guest. The writer and director are the same team that brought us You're Next and a few segments from V/H/S and V/H/S/2. Personally I loved You're Next - it was a straight up horror comedy with little to no surprises. Here, the duo hone their strengths into their magnum opus so to speak. The Guest is an action thriller, but there are a lot more elements at work. It's dramatic, it's funny, it's intense, and it gets pretty frightening at times. The scope seems very wide but it all flows together without a hitch, and each emotional reaction keeps your eyes glued to the screen waiting for what happens next. The Guest is held together by its lead, Dan Stevens. I haven't seen him in anything before this but he was flawless in this role as an enigmatic, seemingly charming family friend. David is immensely likable, even when questionable things start happening you still want to root for the guy. He just has a badass aura around him. Dan Stevens plays him with such conviction that you can't see through him and you have no idea what is going on in his head, but you know that there's more to him than meets the eye.When I say sh*t goes down in this movie, I mean it. Sh*t. Goes. Down. I won't spoil anything but The Guest has one of the most stylish, suspenseful, colorful, and downright invigorating third acts in a movie I've seen in a while. It's f*cking magnificent. Some people are split on this opinion but honestly, I thought it was an absolute blast. It takes place in a Halloween fun house; as soon as it began I turned into a giddy schoolgirl. Yeah, it's just that much fun. The first two acts are impeccable as well, building up the tension and suspense to a level of tangibility that you can cut with a knife. The characters surrounding David are all great as well. They're your typical family, and although it may seem like they're just caricatures, they are completely convincing in their roles largely due to the realistic dialogue. Everything progresses believably and exactly how you'd want it to, and the predictability is a strength in this case because it gives the filmmakers a chance to make the simple premise as shiny and creative as possible. I was not bored for a minute of this movie. The soundtrack is phenomenal too - it has an '80s thriller vibe and a lot of dark electronic grooves similar to those in You're Next but even better.The Guest is an action-thriller buff's wet dream, and it even throws in some horror for good measure. It really is one of the most underrated movies of 2014 and an experience that no thriller fan should miss out on.\",\n",

       " 'Set during an unspecified future era, Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a construction worker who longs for a trip to Mars. His wife, Lori (Sharon Stone) isn\\'t so keen on it--she\\'d prefer a trip to Saturn, or a space cruise. Riding on the subway one day, Quaid notices a television advertisement for a company named Rekall, which specializes in memory implants of vacations. Quaid checks into it as an alternate means of having a \"Mars vacation\". While at Rekall, he chooses an alternate personality upgrade of a secret agent. However, while undergoing the procedure, something goes wrong. He learns that his Quaid identity was a memory implant and he really _is_ a secret agent. Now that he has his real memory back, he\\'s on the run and he escapes to Mars. But why is everyone after him? Total Recall, based on \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\", a short story from 1974 by Philip K. Dick (and novelized in conjunction with the film production by Piers Anthony), had a laborious history getting to the silver screen. Tens of drafts were written. Production companies were attached then went out of business. Many directors and stars were attached who either changed their minds or who were dropped. Luckily, Arnold Schwarzenegger talked Carolco into picking up the project for him, with Paul Verhoeven--who\\'d already proved his mettle on the similarly toned RoboCop (1987)--on board as director, because this is an excellent film.While Total Recall certainly has influences, including \"The Martian Chronicles\" (1980), Dune (1984) and the first major film based on a Philip K. Dick work, Blade Runner (1982), it\\'s more notable for the films that it has influenced in subsequent years, including The Fifth Element (1997) and many of the \"rubber reality\" films such as Abre los ojos (1997)/Vanilla Sky (2001) and The Thirteenth Floor (1999). It\\'s also yet another film on the very long list that have had various elements \"adapted\" into part of The Matrix (1999)--most explicitly here, the \"bug\" that Quaid has to remove from his body with a high-tech machine and the possibility of \"waking up\" from a particular reality by taking \"the red pill\".Although it\\'s easy to interpret Total Recall in a very straightforward manner, so that the bulk of what we\\'re seeing at any particular moment and the bulk of the dialogue are the literal reality, very convincing arguments can be made that the majority of the film is a depiction of Quaid\\'s memory implant while in the \"patient\\'s chair\" at Rekall. And those certainly aren\\'t the only two interpretations possible.What matters more than thinking one has a \"right answer\", though, is the deeply captivating story that provokes our interpretations and the amount of fun we have getting there. Verhoeven and the scriptwriting team, which included Dan O\\'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, the writing team behind the Alien films (beginning with Alien, 1979), never let us go very long without another plot twist, most of which force a reinterpretation of the material that went before. The twists occur about once per every ten minutes, if not more frequently.The film is notable for its special effects by Rob Bottin, which were far ahead of their time, and its fantastic production and art design, which manage to make us feel both that we\\'re experiencing a vicarious trip to a \"future grunge\" Mars and an almost \"Doctor Who\" (1963)-ish absurdly artificial reality, complete with supersaturated red skies, ala Frank R. Paul\\'s illustrated covers for the Amazing Stories fiction magazine.Some locations in Mexico were used for the film, including some subway shots on Mars, and actual commercial sign age was incorporated into the film. There\\'s a lot of fun to be had noticing all of the cultural differences and similarities that the future era of the film will bring. Verhoeven delights in subtle glimpses of various symbols and accoutrement\\'s. His view of the future is one full of corruption, commercialism and decadence. He doesn\\'t have much confidence in a \"bright new world\" as humans spread out to new territory.Verhoeven is basically extending the way things are now to the future; it\\'s as if he sees our state as indicative of human nature, so that as long as we\\'re humans, people are going to be taking advantage of one another, trying to control one another, engaging in behavior that\\'s a conflict between desires and societal mores, but also helping out each other when the going gets tough. In these respects, Total Recall has culture-satirical similarities to later films such as Starship Troopers (1997), which isn\\'t surprising given that Verhoeven directed both films. It\\'s notable that Total Recall\\'s future is not quite as bleak as Starship Trooper\\'s.But the film is hardly less violent. Verhoeven\\'s initial cut was given an X by the MPAA for violence. A number of scenes had to have small edits, most of which have thankfully been restored on at least one special edition DVD. The violence here is a lot more small scale and personal than Starship Troopers. In terms of the visceral, Total Recall often rides a gray area somewhere between action and horror. While the action isn\\'t as explosive as many Schwarzenegger films, the suspense never resolves until the end. This is an amazing thrill ride of a film.',\n",
       " \"This movie is extremely well made.  Make sure you get the original director's cut, or Special Edition as they are calling it on the DVD.  It includes the real ending, along with more than 20 minutes of additional footage.  The morons from the studio in Hollywood decided that the public wouldn't want to see a nearly 3-hour underwater adventure, and forced James Cameron to cut it down and change the ending.  The ending the studios insisted on is your typical boring old done-a-million-times happy ending, and does not work.  It betrays the message of the film, and makes it nothing more than a good underwater shoot-em-up.  This movie is much more than that. See the REAL ending to understand why it is so important to this film.  As opposed to the canned studio ending, the REAL one makes you think.  Well, what did you expect?  Hollywood executives make movies for the common herd, they dumb them down to make sure every patron goes away feeling happy.  God forbid that anyone actually may have to think a little.  At the time, despite a few solid hits (such as the original Terminator), James Cameron wasn't enough of a power in La-La land to force the studios to release the movie as he wanted it to be.  After Titanic, they will do whatever he says, so we can now expect some great Cameron films to look forward to, rather than having to wait for the REAL movie to come out years later on a Special Edition DVD.\",\n",
       " \"In short, is this a masterpiece? No. Is it groundbreaking? No. But what it is, is entertaining and fun. As some critics have pointed out, it feels very 90's. Which I believe works.It has a great cast, cool yet admittedly wack concept, fun set pieces and a nice soundtrack. However, what is of course the best part of the film and it's main selling point: killer aliens and Chris Pratt. The aliens have a nice design, and are perfect for the summer blockbuster style.Pratt is excellent and continues prove to be an actor who feels like he's in the wrong era, the perfect 80's and 90's leading man.The story isn't all that deep or thorough, and the characters could use work. But Pratt delivers and the cast is still fun.Perhaps one or two too many jokes, and again the writing is far from great, but the film does acknowledge what it is whilst still providing some emotional stakes.J. K. Simmons is also excellent as always.All in all, a decent and fun alien/monster adventure film. I feel it could've bettered from a non-PG-13 rating.Biggest issue was the overuse of CGI. But sadly that's the ways movies seem to go these days.That said, with all the garbage Hollywood releases, and with all the comic book and franchise films, and of course you award winners, it is nice to have a film that doesn't necessarily feel those categories. In short, a fun film. Shame it released on streaming, would've been better in the cinema.Don't buy into the overly positive or aggressively negative reviews. This film ain't that bad or that amazing (objectively) but is exactly what you want from a sci-fi summer blockbuster.As always decide for yourself, but if you're reading this and need some swaying: I recommend The Tomorrow War. 7.5/10.\",\n",
       " \"Simply put, this is a future cult film for a new generation. The zombie sub-genre is one that is so incredibly saturated that it can be hard to find a decent new film as we have to wade through tons of sewage to find anything with some value. Thankfully, after a fair bit of digging, we have one with Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse. It's a film that will appeal to the new generations of horror fans who were born into this nutty zombie infested pop culture, and it should also resonate with the well travelled horror fans who grew up on a diet of Evil Dead and Re-Animator. It's not going to be a mainstream success, and it's not going to appeal to everybody but Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse is a blast of fun from start to finish.It's clear from the opening scene of the film that aims to be a bucket of bloody fun. As a foolish janitor messes around with some laboratory equipment and comes across a strange looking comatose patient, he accidentally causes the them to flat-line and awkwardly tries provide CPR. His efforts are clearly in vain as he pushes his hands through the patients chest and wakes up the living dead, thus causing the zombie outbreak.The comedy in the film ranges from hilarious mutilation of corpses, wacky animal zombies to plain stupidity, but it is none the less entertaining every step of the way. Highlights include a scene involving a trampoline, which had my body cringing in disgust and almost laughing hysterically at the same time, and a surreal rendition of a classic Britney Spears song. The climax owes a lot to the gaming franchise Dead Rising as the boys use the scout skills to craft hand- built weapons from a hardware store for maximum zombie killing impact.Despite the zombies being a primary part of the proceedings, it would have been a shell of a film had it not had the central friendship between the characters of Ben, Carter, and Augie. We can all relate to a group of friends on an adventure, and their dynamic has shades of 80s classics like The Goonies and Stand By Me. It isn't drawing on anything new but it doesn't pretend to either as it feels like a hokey sentimental tribute to cult favourites such as The Monster Squad. The 80s are very much beating in the lively heart of this horror.I'm a horror fan through and through, and the genre needs feel good films like this, equal parts gore and laughs with a splat of gratuitous nudity for good measure. At the end of the day isn't that what fun horrors are all about?\",\n",
       " \"Toy Story is not only the best Disney film because it has the best story and the best animation, but also because of the excellent actors chosen to provide the voices of the animals. The casting was perfect from top to bottom, and the movie provides an excellent adventure story about friendship and loyalty that keeps you engrossed until the nail-biting climax.\\nTom Hanks and Tim Allen provided excellent voices for Woody and Buzz Lightyear -their performances alone are one of the biggest things that made this such a spectacular movie. Besides that, though, you have the excellent story that is not only noteworthy because it has never really been told from this perspective before, but also because it was just told so well. All of the characters in the film are very well developed and all have appropriate and effective actors chosen to provide their voices. And of course, who could forget the revolutionary animation! The computer animation used for this movie not only made it startlingly realistic but also opened up tons of possibilities, and thankfully the filmmakers chose to explore these possibilities. There are dozens of things that are hidden in the woodwork throughout the film, as well as in the songs \\x96 note, for example, the subtle playing of the Indiana Jones theme song in the scene where Woody knocks Buzz out the window with the desk lamp.\\nToy Story is by far the best Disney film ever made, it's pretty much perfect. It's adventurous, it's exciting, it's entertaining, it's good for the whole family, it's got great characters, story, and plot, and above all, it's fun.\",\n",
       " \"`National Lampoon's Animal House' may have been one of the first comedies to evolve from the `Saturday Night Live' generation, but it could be argued that `Caddyshack,' directed by Harold Ramis-- and which features two SNL alumni, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray-- actually spawned the entire `SNL genre,' of films, because this is the one that seemed to lock in that formulaic irreverence toward all things, of which they are so indicative. The story here revolves around a young man named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a caddy at the upscale Bushwood Country Club, who is bucking for a caddy scholarship to get him into college.  Danny figures that the best shot he has at it is to volunteer for the assignment none of the other caddies want-- to caddy for the up-tight Judge Smails (Ted Knight), one of the executive directors of Bushwood, and `kiss up' a bit.  Smails responds by letting Danny mow his lawn and attend a christening ceremony for his new yacht.  But Danny is not one to be deterred, even when the good Judge tells him `The world needs ditch diggers, too.'  He just goes on, keeping his eyes and his options open.And it isn't long before Danny gets involved with Ty Webb (Chase), an independently wealthy goof-ball with a Zen/Chaplin philosophy of life, whose father was one of Judge Smails' partners in Bushwood.  So Danny takes some advice from Ty while caddying for him; advice which just may ultimately have an effect on whether or not he gets his scholarship.  Or maybe not.  Words of wisdom like `Be the Ball,' and `A donut with no hole is a danish,' may not be what he needs to put him on the fast track to success.  But then again, you never know; it's that kind of movie.  And there's no getting around it, this is funny stuff.The humor in this movie runs the gamut from broad to subtle, with at least two sight gags thrown in that identify it as belonging to the genre it helped create.  At the time of it's theatrical release, in 1980, it was fairly on the cutting edge of comedy; by today's standards, though, it doesn't seem nearly as irreverent, especially given the digressive trend in the genre lately, which has spewed forth such fare as `Freddy Got Fingered,' and `Road Trip.'  Then again, this one had Harold Ramis behind the camera, and Ramis has an acute sense of comedic timing, he knows what works, and he made the most of the basic screenplay (by Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney) and the terrific cast of comedians with which he had to work, all of whom fit so well into the pattern and fabric of this particular picture.Rarely does a comedy (or any film for that matter) have so many actors who fit their characters so perfectly as in this film, beginning with Chevy Chase, who embodies the slightly skewed and off-center Ty Webb so well it's almost frightening.  Webb is a guy who veritably floats through life in a perpetual Zen-like state of distraction, and it makes you realize that there probably really are characters like this walking around in the real world. But if the existence of a Ty Webb type is only highly probable, there's no doubt whatsoever about the fact that there are guys like Al Czervik amongst us.Rodney Dangerfield plays Czervik, the obnoxious, fun-loving, high-rolling land developer with a specially made golf club and an eye on Bushwood.  In Czervik, Dangerfield creates a character who is outrageous, droll, lacks any taste whatsoever, and is entirely hilarious.  It is, without question, the best character and performance of Dangerfield's cinematic career, and -- like Chase-- it's almost scary the way he fits into the character so naturally and completely.The real heart of this movie, however, is Bill Murray, who turns in what just may be the definitive Murray performance with his character, Carl Spackler, the Assistant Greenskeeper at Bushwood.  Murray brings Carl, the socially and intellectually challenged man-with-a-plan, to life with subtle nuance and a flare of comedic genius.  A lot of what he did in this film was improvised, including much of his two most memorable and hilarious scenes, one in which he's describing his encounter with the Dalai Lama, and the other being his soliloquy of the `Cinderella Boy' on the course at Atlanta. This is truly inspired, funny stuff, and it proves what can be done without resorting to banal vulgarity or crudeness (not that this film is entirely devoid of it, but at least it's tempered here somewhat-- not so overt and in-your-face like you'll often find in some of the more recent offerings of the genre).  And there's a harmless shiftiness about Carl, who is about as deep as a pan pizza, and Murray plays it all beautifully.O'Keefe gives a solid performance, as well, but he's basically the straight man here, the set-up guy for one funny situation after another.  And he does it quite nicely.Also giving memorable performances are Ted Knight, as the rigid, conservative Judge, and Brian Doyle-Murray as Lou Loomis, who oversees the caddies at Bushwood.The supporting cast includes Sarah Holcomb (Maggie), Scott Colomby (Tony), Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall), Dan Resin (Dr. Beeper), Henry Wilcoxon (The Bishop), Albert Salmi (Mr. Noonan), John F. Barmon Jr. (Spaulding Smails) and Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smails).  With this film, Ramis and company honed the formula for comedy that incorporated pop culture and contemporary sensibilities into it like never before.  And `Caddyshack' is an example of it in it's purest form; you'll have to look long and hard to find anything out of this same mold today that can come close to the prototype.  It's one of those movies that gets even better with age-- and funnier, too.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.\",\n",
       " 'I attended the world premiere of \"Cashback\" at the Toronto International Film Festival. I walked out in a daze. I had a feeling I\\'d seen something special, that moment when you have to pause to take a breath and reflect on what you\\'ve experienced. I still had about 20 films to go at the time, and \"Cashback\" raised the bar and became the benchmark against which all the others would have to be compared. As it turned out, nothing came close. Of the 30 plus films I saw that week, \"Cashback\" tops the list.Literally built around the short film of the same name which screened at festivals in 2004, triple threat writer/director/producer Sean Ellis did something ingenious. Rather than take his 20 minute piece and expand it to fill 90 minutes, he created a new Act One and Act Three to bookend a reworking of the original short in the center. And he pulled it off with a tour de force of light and sound. The result is an eerie, compelling twist on the classic Outer Limits episode where time stops while the protagonist weaves in and out of the frozen characters in another dimension. It may sound like sci-fi, but this is a sweet romantic comedy whose storyline is among the most original I\\'ve ever seen on screen. The concept is brilliant and the result magnificent.The look is lush, cinematography by Angus Hudson breathtaking, and \"Cashback\" features an appropriately sweet score. They combine to give this low budget project a big movie feel, destined for the wide audience it deserves.Most of all, I believe \"Cashback\" is the vehicle which will introduce newcomer Sean Biggerstaff (Oliver Wood of \"Harry Potter\") to the world. His star tun in this film as protagonist Ben Willis left me speechless. The camera loves him, and he is on screen virtually from opening to closing credits. This film is his to make or break. It rests on his shoulders, and he owns the material.As they say, you\\'ll laugh, you\\'ll cry, and I walked out with a tear in my eye and a smile on my face. And no other film I saw at the Toronto Film Festival did that to me. \"Cashback\" is a sweet little masterpiece.',\n",

I don\\'t disagree with them.But I\\'d like to add a suggestion to those of you out there who haven\\'t seen this film.  I\\'d like to tell you HOW to watch it.The people who made this movie didn\\'t think they were producing a masterpiece. Bergman left the shoot disgusted.  The screenwriters were on salary for Warners, writing half a dozen movies a year, and this was just one more.  Bogie was punching the clock in the middle of a workhorse career.So as an audience member, you can\\'t sit down expecting gilded greatness.Don\\'t have a Casablaca party.  Don\\'t watch it on your first date, hoping it will lend that \"Romantic Touch.\"  Don\\'t watch it as part of your \"I need to watch the Best 10 movies of all time\" Film School project.Buy this movie on DVD.  Have it at the ready.  And then, one Friday night, when your plans fall through and you find it\\'s 10:30pm and there\\'s nothing on TV that\\'s any good, open a six pack of beer, or pour yourself some wine, and watch this movie in a darkened room.The characters in Casablanca are absolutely devoid of sentimentalism.  Every one of them sees the world without a hint of rose color in their lenses.  As Rick says, \"Three little people don\\'t amount to a hill of beans in this big old world.\"  If you\\'re in a mood where you understand what he\\'s saying, watch this movie and it will transport you.There is no single movie that deserves to be called the best movie of all time.  Because movies, when all is said and done, don\\'t amount to a hill of beans.  They are meant to entertain us, not for us to worship THEM.But no movie has ever known this fact like Casablanca.\\nIf you watch Casablance this way, with no expectations, with no \"hype,\" you might catch 10 percent of its greatness on one viewing.  And that will be enough to start you on your way.Happy viewing, kid.',\n",
       " \"How did Holly Hunter not win that Oscar? Why weren't Evan Rachel Wood and Nikki Reed at least nominated, let alone winners?I have seen many films in my time, and none have held such great performances as this, and few have spoken to the audience in such a powerful way.Holly Hunter, who is always superb, outdid herself in the role of Mel, the caring mother who doesn't know when to put a tighter grip on her daughter, Tracy. Her performance is so touching, and so painful that you want to get inside her and show her what she needs to do.Evan Rachel Wood is outstanding as Tracy, the young girl who so desperately wants to fit in, and will go to any lengths to get that. Wood is always good, but she too has outdone herself, and perfectly nailed the role of Tracy. Not once does she come across as a pretentious actress trying to act like a teen.Nikki Reed, who was introduced by this film, delivers a performance that is worth the ticket fare alone. Evie is so manipulative, so seductive, and so real that you can't possibly blame Tracy for wanting to be like her.Whoever it is who decides who gets the Oscars - wake up and realise that you need to award these to the performances, not the actors who wear the nicer dresses!Thirteen is one of the more powerful pieces of cinema around. The camera probes right into the livers of our protagonists, denying anyone the joy if seeing this grim masterpiece from a safe distance. The soundtrack rocks along to the emotions of the characters. The performances create not only a good film, but a little disturbing slice of life.Having seen Thirteen, I now understand why people label some films as important. this is certainly one of them.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ll start straight off the cuff. Niccol is one of my favourite writer/directors. In fact, one of my favourite films is Gattaca, which has been so under-rated over the years since its release. To me he\\'s been a great Sci-Fi writer, so going into this I was hopeful of something of quality.Alas, \"In Time\" is not for the true Sci-Fi thinker. It paints a world in which time is money. That isn\\'t that new an idea, but Niccols does succeed in pushing the metaphor as a commodity. Those with time are rich, those without time are poor. It\\'s a simplistic analogy. As with Niccol\\'s other films, the cinematography is beautiful. The best actors in the film aren\\'t the main characters, rather Cillian Murphy, Vincent Kartheiser and (surprisingly) Alex Pettyfer present more interesting characters. They all shine, especially Murphy. The film seems like one long car chase, when what you actually want to delve into are the complexities - the debates between the characters themselves over the issues of the world they live in. Not a single clever conversation happens between anyone. Murphy is a great actor and I would have been interested to see the debate about right and wrong become greyed through some thinking. Life is not black and white. The film ending is unrealistic and I wonder if this was the ending envisioned by Niccol or the ending the producers wanted to boost sales. Sadly this film could have been a great deal more. It had a good topic. It had some great actors, yet it failed because the story lost the nuances and complexities to meet the lowest common denominator, rather than raising questions or making the viewer think critically. See it, but be prepared to be disappointed. It isn\\'t subtle.',\n",
       " 'Before I get to sink my claws in what I think is very wrong with this film, I have to say upfront that it\\'s an hell of a lot better film than \"Jurassic Park 3\" just for the glaring fact that \"Jurassic Park 3\" was that bad of a movie. So much so that poor Sam Neill can\\'t live it down for the way the screenwriters ruined his character and the credibility of the series as a whole.Now we have part 4, which is called \"Jurassic World\" and while it\\'s a major league improvement over the dismal \"Jurassic Park 3\", its still can\\'t live up to the quality of what Spielberg achieved with the work he did with the first two Jurassic Park films ( The original and it\\'s sequel \"The Lost World\".) This film takes place 22 years after the original and Jurassic World is fully operational but the mystic of dinosaurs has worn off and the resort needs a new attraction to bring in new customers. So they create a new dinosaur called the Indominus Rex, a leaner, meaner animal that is made to bring in and wow the crowds. At this point of the film for me when they introduce this monster, I can hear what Jurassic Park\\'s mainstay Ian Malcolm would have said during this moment and it would not have been kind. If you remember the character of Ian Malcolm (played wonderfully by Jeff Goldblum) he\\'s pretty much the best character in the Jurassic Park films. The reason being is the fact that he not only represented what the audience was thinking during the films ( Well, the first two movies, not the god awful 3rd one) but was the voice of sarcastic reason and reality to John Hammond\\'s flights of fancy. Too bad he\\'s not around in this movie because he would be pretty much putting down almost every character in this film for their ignorance and stupidity, which was the audience\\'s reaction in my theater through out this entire duration of the film. Chris Pratt plays pretty much the only likable character in the entire film and pretty much the only character with some brains in his head. That\\'s a good thing considering that we would have no one to root for to at least survive the massacre that comes when the Indominus Rex finally and predictably goes on it\\'s killing rampage. Bryce Dallas Howard really does not have much to do other than be surprised by her character\\'s stupidity, which is a shame cause she really is a good actress and Vincent D\"Onofrio is given a one note role which is a crime cause he\\'s a damn fine actor. Throw in two of the most annoying kids ever to be stranded on a dinosaur resort ( (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) and you have a cast of characters who almost deserves to be dino chow. Despite the dumb characters and the leaps in logic and common sense, the movie does work as a entertaining time waster. There are some pockets of excitement to be had and the climax really does deliver the goods but this is all this film is about. It\\'s really a monster movie, not a Jurassic Park film and while Chris Pratt gives us the only character in the film to root for, not even he can cover up the film\\'s huge mistakes in story, logic and characterization.As the character of Ian Malcolm said to John Hammond in \"The Lost World\".John Hammond: \"Don\\'t worry, I\\'m not making the same mistakes again.\" Dr. Ian Malcolm: \"No, you\\'re making all new ones.\"This pretty much sums up Jurassic World as a whole.',\n",
       " \"This is one of those movies that is somewhat entertaining upon first viewing but is easily forgettable and has nothing of substance to make a second viewing possible to enjoy. The plot is convoluted as we don't know what the main characters are doing or why. In fact, everything we know about the 4 magicians is revealed in the first 10 minutes of the movie and after that there is ZERO character development! The entire movie appears to have been made solely for the sake of the ending and yet it was so cliché that I was actually a little angry about the way they did it. It's unfortunate that in the filmmaker's attempts to be clever they neglected the most fundamental elements of storytelling: plot and character.Like a magic show without magic, you may find yourself somewhat entertained but inevitably wind up disappointed in the end because they left out the most important part of the show.\",\n",

There's no denying that the book is sheer genius, but in all honesty this film adaptation is exceptionally well made too. In fact, it comes high up on my list of all-time movie favourites.The Wonka Chocolate Factory is an amazing building from which some of the most scrumdiddlyumptious sweets are delivered to the world's candy stores. Wonka-mania hits the world when five golden tickets are hidden inside packs of Wonka bars - for the winners will be granted a tour of the top-secret factory. Young Charlie Bucket, a poor boy whose family cottage lies within sight of Wonka's factory, dreams of becoming a winner - but with barely a penny to his name, does he have a chance?What makes Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory such a success is the way it skillfully blends entertainment and a serious underlying moral. Each winning child is exposed as being rotten-to-the-core, then dealt with harshly and dismissively by Wonka. Seeing these awful brats get their come-uppance is hilarious, enjoyable and - on a serious level - quite eye-opening (it's as if parents in the audience are being told how to prevent their children from turning bad). Gene Wilder was simply born to play Wonka (every eccentric phrase, every bemused expression, and every mischievous glance is judged to perfection). The film's set design is fabulous, with particular high-spots including the chocolate room, the egg room and the wacky corridor which gets smaller and narrower the closer you get to the end. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is simply magic - a film that everyone must see, especially parents whose kids are just becoming that bit too big for their boots!\",\n",
       " 'Every summer a film comes around that takes everyone by surprise.  Last year it was Scary Movie and I\\'m sure in 1977 it was a film like Star Wars and then in 1981 it was Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Now I am not saying that The Fast and the Furious is in the same class as Raiders and Star Wars, just that it surprised everyone on the same level.  F&F is short on plot and dialogue and even some of the acting is lame, but what it is oozes is testosterone.  It pumps your blood, increases your adrenaline and attacks you with fast cars, sexy women and that one invariable that I think it has going for it... Vin Diesel.  There is just something about the guy, something that you really can\\'t put your finger on, but he just has it. Maybe it is charisma, maybe it is charm, maybe it is just that he resembles some of the action heroes from the 80\\'s with his chiseled triceps and his slabs of pecs.  Maybe it is all those things and maybe it is none of those things, all I know is that F&F is exactly what I had hoped it would be and nothing more.  This is the summer movie that I have been waiting for.  It\\'s not that the films that have been out so far aren\\'t that great because some of them are, it\\'s just that this is the one that epitomises what summer as a teen ager is all about.  It is no wonder that exit polls for this film were around 65-70% under the age of 21.  And maybe that is why I enjoyed it so much.  I am pushing 30 but isn\\'t it cool to lose yourself in a film that reminds you what it was like to be in highschool.  And isn\\'t it cool to watch street racers break 140 miles an hour wile they shoot NOS through their vehicles?  Well isn\\'t it?F&F doesn\\'t contain any machinations similar to a film like Mission Impossible and it doesn\\'t dazzle us with special effects of impending doom like Armageddon did, but it takes us into a world where people live life \"a quarter of a mile at a time.\"  Vin Diesel plays Dominic Toretto, a massive, bald mechanic that owns a garage but street races on the side to make some extra cash.  Paul Walker ( The Skulls, Varsity Blues) plays Brian Spindler.  He is a cop that has infiltrated the street gang to find out who is highjacking trucks and stealing all their merchandise.  There are about four rival street gangs in L.A. and one of them is pulling this off.  He has to figure out which one. Of course along the way he seduced by the life, but that is not what we really care about.  All we want to see is lots of racing, a few crashes, some fights and some sex.  F&F doesn\\'t disappoint.  If what you have seen in the trailers of the film excites and entices you, then you know exactly what you\\'re in for.  This is not going to win any Oscars for anything but what it will do is entertain you.  It will expedite you for 90 minutes into a world where Honda\\'s are souped up to look like Dragons and junkyard scraps are rebuilt from scratch to be better than they were before, better, stronger and faster.  If this film appealed to you in the commercial, it will appeal to you on the screen.And of course there is Vin Diesel.  He first made a name for himself in Saving Private Ryan where he played Capparrzo.  Then he jumped onto the scene with his excellent and grandiose turn as Riddick in Pitch Black.  I think this is the film that got him noticed because no one had even heard of him before this.  Then he did Boiler Room and he showed a different side to him.  But F&F is all muscle and sheer bravado.  I think Vin is going to do great things in the years to come.  He is not a nobody anymore.  This film will take care of that.

       " 'Although this film has bizarrely been described as breezy summer entertainment by some top critics (which leads me to wonder if they saw the same movie I did, or just the first half hour), \"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\" is the closest thing to the sort of examination of relationships that Allen became famous for in quite some time (\"Anything Else\" counts, I suppose, but lacks the sharpness this film has), and although it is far from as weighty as some of his dramas or even some of his comedies, this is his first really inspired script in a while, featuring a cast of detailed, well-developed characters, some razor-sharp observations on relationships, and a wicked sense of humor.Although I never thought Woody\\'s work this decade was particularly poor (other than \"Cassandra\\'s Dream\" and although I\\'m in a minority \"Match Point\"), it has mostly been completely inconsequential and almost entirely dependent on broad characterizations and heavy plotting rather than real people and awkwardly comic situations (which has always been Allen\\'s strong suit). A career-best performance from Scarlett Johansson, a wickedly entertaining turn from Penelope Cruz, and the absolute revelation that is Rebecca Hall form a great cast along with Javier Bardem in a role that may surprise the majority of the American public (well, for most of the movie, anyway). You can feel Allen\\'s mark on their mannerisms, but they all seem to disappear into these characters, that\\'s how good they are.I\\'m keeping this as spoiler-free as possible, because it\\'s really worth going into the theater not expecting anything in particular and savoring the film\\'s often unexpected but never contrived plot twists and turns. All you should know is that Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) go to Barcelona for the summer and things get complicated when they meet a charming, mysterious, and rich painter (Javier Bardem) and he makes a rather upfront proposition to both of them. It\\'s best if you know nothing of how Cruz\\' character impacts the film prior to watching it.In relation to Allen\\'s other work I thought it was interesting that he never attempted to analyze sex. The whole movie is in many ways about sex, and there is a lot of the expected philosophical and psychological examination of the relationships between the characters in the film, but sex itself is never analyzed as it is in much of Allen\\'s work, and is instead treated as the impenetrable mystery it is. That said, Allen\\'s script is extraordinarily nuanced, something that I haven\\'t expected from his writing in a while. Sure, the characters still represent opposing romantic philosophies, but there\\'s a spark in the writing that makes these feel like real people as opposed to mere characters. That spark, that chemistry is there throughout \"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\", it\\'s there in the vibrant cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe, it\\'s there in the performances, it\\'s there in the shot composition, and it\\'s there in the editing, and in pretty much anything else I haven\\'t mentioned yet. The first forty minutes or so of \"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\" may be the sort of romantic comedy (very good romantic comedy, at that) that the advertising campaign seems to suggest it is, but for the rest of the film there\\'s the sort of pessimistic optimism that colors much of Allen\\'s work (if that makes sense, pretend you didn\\'t read it if it didn\\'t), and let\\'s just say it doesn\\'t end well for these characters. There\\'s real complexity and intensity in this film, and all I have to say is this: Woody Allen is back, the perceptive, intelligent examiner of the human heart, that is, not what we\\'ve had for the past while. To say this is one of his best films would be ignoring the fact that through the 70\\'s and 80\\'s he pretty much made nothing but great films, but I can at least say that this is on par with some of his better work.8.5/10',\n",

A particularly funny scene is when the police tell him to freeze, you\\'d better believe that he freezes! All in all, Jim Carrey\\'s humor will never get old.

       " \"That was way too long. It got to the point where enough was enough. After about an hour I couldn't wait for it to end. Art The Clown looks great and there's some gnarly kill scenes, but that's literally it. The acting's terrible and there's almost zero storyline. All this film consists of is a killer clown running around slaughtering people. Why people are so into these films is beyond me. Don't get me wrong! I enjoy horror films just as much as the next guy, but some of these kill scenes are extremely overdone. You gotta be somewhat sadistic to be into this stuff. When it was all said and done it's just an all around cheesy film. 5 stars.\",\n",
       " \"Its very rare that a movie like Atonement comes along and leaves me completely speechless and in complete and utter awe for hours after I have seen it. You see Atonement isn't just the best movie I have seen all year, its one of the best movies I have seen in a very, very long time. And by that I include Pan's Labyrinth, yes this movie is better than my favourite movie of 2006, and I never imagined Atonement would ever come close to that level of greatness until fifteen minutes into the movie last night. Atonement is an unusual movie, in fact its fair to say that I have never seen anything quite like it. Its a rare movie that actually I adored so much that I am going to hunt down a copy of the book tomorrow just to see the comparisons. Its not an easy movie I'll be honest, if you go in expecting something light hearted and easy to digest then you will leave the cinema feeling very cheated. This is a movie that deals with very dark things at times. No matter how much I desire to write in depth about every aspect of the movie I just can't, the movies greatest triumph is the fact that its plot is so intricately woven that if you ruin one part of the storyline to anyone then the movies impact is slightly lessened. The storyline is just brilliant, but its the climax that leaves you in store for the biggest shocker, and its this shocker that leaves you reeling long after you have left the cinema. The performances here are all spectacular, I think its fair to say that the two leads, James McAvoy and Keira Knightly shall be receiving at the very least nominations for Best Actor/Best Actress. The score is beautiful, whoever came up with the idea of using a typewriter as a musical instrument deserves to be praised heavily. Its rare a score leaves me feeling moved, the score in this movie did that for me. That's yet another Oscar that this movie deserves to win. All in all Atonement is just perfection, I doubt you'll find a better movie this year or even for the next three years. In a time when Blockbusters get all the attention it is nice to see a small, but intelligent movie leave me in awe.As I previously mentioned the performances in this movie is simply amazing. Keira Knightly is an odd actress, while she proved herself in Pride and Prejudice, yes I have unfortunately seen that movie, she comes across as a wooden actress in films like Pirates of the Caribbean. Atonement really sees her at her best yet. Her character is different from what we've seen Knightly play before. Usually she goes for the spunky females, this time she seems more like a proper lady, albeit one that smokes constantly and is a bit stuck up for her own good. Keira Knightly excels in the earlier, more laid back sequences, but its in the later stuff, the more powerful stuff that we see just how talented an actress she truly is. Despite all my praise for Knightly she still plays second fiddle to James McAvoy. The former actor of Shameless and Narnia is on a roll lately. His excellent, although sadly overlooked performance in The Last King of Scotland still sticks firmly in memory. But his performance here is simple breathtaking. One sequence in particular where we see his acting talent come to light has to be the sequence in Dunkirk (more on that later), no words but the performance says everything. Knightly might not be certain to win an Oscar, but McAvoy surely is! Its also refreshing to see a young actress, Saoirse Ronan, not be eye gougingly irritating, but rather a superb actress. Her character, Briony, is a vital character in the movie, and for such a young actress she delivers her performance so chillingly brilliant. Unfortunately next to this brilliant performance, Romola Garai who plays an older Briony pales in comparison. Her performance is still brilliant, but not as effective nor as memorable as the younger actress. The storyline of Atonement is where the film holds most of its impact. Essentialy the film is about a lie that Briony tells, and how it affects the lives of her, Cecilia, and most importantly of all, Robbie. That's pretty much all I can and will say of the storyline. A lot more happens over the course of the movie, and a lot of stuff that you think will happen doesn't, and things you think won't happen will. The ending is a prime example of this and to be honest I didn't see it coming. The way the movie is directed is also something note. The beautiful colours of the summer house are amazing, but the way the camera moves around the house makes it even better. But the direction will be remembered for one scene in this movie, and its in Dunkirk. I mentioned this previously for the performance in that scene, what I failed to mention is that the shot is a continuous shot that lasts five minutes as we see the chaos of Dunkirk. From horses being shot to a man hanging from a ferris wheel, the sequence is shown in all its glory. It really is a powerful moment, and probably the one scene that got me closest to tears, purely because of the singing in the background, it is shocking just how amazing this sequence truly is.Overall Atonement is a perfect movie, in actual fact its a movie with pretty much no flaws whatsoever. Superb performances, beautiful direction, a script and storyline to die for. It is unlikely any film will top this for a very long time, this is something that will go down in cinema history as being a classic, and it highly deserves it inevitable status.\",\n",

And due to the advertising I knew there\\'d be plenty of stuff \"gettin\\' blowed up real good.\" But what I wasn\\'t expecting was the tongue in cheek jokes, dark humor, and respectable plot twist! Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will only fuel rumors of their relationship with their performances - their chemistry on screen is scintillating, to say the least. The allure of each actor as an individual is undeniable, but when they\\'re together, whether getting busy or getting pummeled, the screen fairly sizzles. It\\'s a popcorn, Hollywood movie, of course, and you\\'ll have to get past the fact that the two leads are the only two among many professional killers who seem to be decent shots!

       " 'With Hellboy, Guillermo Del Toro lovingly recreated panels from artist/creator Mike Mignola\\'s comic book stories and brought them to vibrant life, setting a new benchmark for adaptations that respect their source material. With Sin City, however, co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller have done more than just recreate the brutal chiaroscuro of Miller\\'s stark post-modern noir artwork, they\\'ve captured the essence and the aesthetic of Basin City (as much a character as Marv or Hartigan) and brought its universe and characters to a stunning three-dimensional life. And unlike Hellboy, which suffered from a weak, confusing script, Sin City weaves a Pulp Fiction-esque narrative which snakes through the dark streets and crooked alleyways of this hellish metropolis like a fever dream.In short, Sin City delivers a blistering ballet of bullets and blood, dames and danger at every turn. It\\'s a kinetic masterpiece of pop culture for the new millennium (and a case could be made that this was the movie that CGI was invented for).As a Frank Miller fan for over 25 years, I know his work and I know Sin City \\x96 and this Sin City will knock your socks off whether you are a fan or a newcomer to the dark delights of his devilish imagination and brutal style. Exceeding my expectations on all levels, this movie ranks as one of the most enjoyable cinema-going experiences I\\'ve had in years.Everything works here. From Rodriguez\\'s cinematography and editing, to the seamless direction (no mean feat when you consider Robert co-directed with Miller and Quentin Tarantino joined the mix as \"Special Guest Director\"), to the spot-on casting. The script gives Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro plenty of opportunity to chew the scenery \\x96 and they do, especially Rourke, who, despite having his mug buried under a thick layer of gruesome latex, delivers one of the best performances of his career and steals the show as Marv, the giant thug with a broken heart. The ladies hold their own, too. Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy and Jaime King are all great in their roles, particularly Dawson as machine gun-wielding Dominatrix/Hooker-Godmother Gail. And kudos to Elijah Wood (proving there is life after Hobbits) and Nick Stahl who deliver contrasting performances as vile villains, the ultra-creepy Kevin and the disgusting Yellow bastard, respectively.Sin City is smart, stylish, sexy and sick. It\\'s also violent and funny. Certainly not a film for the whole family, but for those of us who enjoy our movies rated R, this flick kicks the head and the gut like a mule.Here\\'s hoping Sin City makes a mint, for there are 10,000 stories in the naked (sinful) city, and this is but a handful of them. I\\'m already praying for a sequel.A picture perfect \"ten\" for this cineast.',\n",

       " 'I have seen Charlie & The Chocolate Factory last night and though I usually don\\'t care very much in giving my opinion, the journey M. Burton and his team made me cross deserves an homage. Especially with all that criticism rising around the film before it has been released.I have been a Tim Burton fan for more than a decade now; I grew up with his films. But what I have been through yesterday his really unique. I actually never thought he would offer us such a film one day. Fans of his first period, with all the lonely and desperate characters won\\'t like it for sure. Since Mars Attacks !, and more specifically since Big Fish, Burton decided to tell things differently. His vision of the world slightly changed in every of his films : now, the rejected freak comes down to the world and stays. A world that remains frightening and weird even thought we call it \"reality\" but a world worth living in. And that\\'s what Charlie & The Chocolate Factory is all about\\x85 It all begins with a main title sequence that may be one of the main weaknesses of the film. The sequence is very entertaining and visually ambitious but they decided to go with CGI and it looks like it was a decision they made in last minute. Since the film was proudly made with \"real\" sets, \"real\" Oompas Loompas, \"real\" squirrels, the main title looks inappropriate. It\\'s not that important but it\\'s a Tim Burton film and we know how much he usually works on his main title. Hopefully, Danny Elfman is there with a crazy mix of the Edward Scissorhands and Spider-Man (the music when the title of the film appears gave me shivers), a true musical roller-coaster that gives a hint on what his score will sound like through the film. After that, it\\'s just emotions. All kinds of them: laughs (many \\x96 the audience laughed almost every thirty seconds), tears of joy (we all know Charlie\\'s gonna find that ticket but when he does, you just can\\'t refrain your heart to beat faster), mercy (the way Burton depicts the social misery of the Bucket\\'s family is really touching), amazement (the Wonka Factory and its many rooms is true wonder, one the most achieved design Burton ever offered us) and many mores. Very much like the book, even though it seems simple and childish, you would like to stop for a second to collect those feelings and try to analyze them but you don\\'t have the time. It just never stops (I realize it might be a flaw for some people in fact). Burton never has been so generous in terms of human warmness.Johnny Depp proposes another inventive and completely wacky interpretation here. I won\\'t compare with Gene Wilder since I don\\'t know the first film very well (pretty unknown flick here in Europe) and those comparisons should stop anyway. Depp makes of Wonka a tormented and unadapted character who doesn\\'t know much about common courtesy and doesn\\'t really care anyway. He built up his own universe in response to his authoritarian father and he\\'s pretty proud of it. He just doesn\\'t want those \"weird\" (a word he likes \\x96 you\\'ve all seen the TV spots) and boring parents with their despicable children to ruin what is life is based on. Yet\\x85 So Depp\\'s Wonka is actually very moving and pathetic in his attempts to entertain his visitors. As Burton does everything he can to make you hate Augustus, Vercua, Violet and Mike at the moment you first see them, you get instantly closer to Wonka when you noticed he feels the same. In addition to that, John August\\'s vision of Wonka\\'s past (including an always perfect cameo by Christopher Lee) offers the character a real depth you didn\\'t expect.Danny Elfman is also one of the main attractions of the film. While his score is already classic Burton/Elfman work with some interesting experiments (the main themes are splendid), the songs he wrote for the Oompas Loompas are just so funny. Hugh laughs in the audience for some musical choices. Those songs don\\'t intend to stay with you for months (it would have been hard as they\\'re based on Dahl\\'s lyrics that doesn\\'t allow Broadway impulses), they\\'re just off-beat numbers playing with many references in so many styles. Oingo Boingo fans have to buy the soundtrack when it\\'ll come out, it\\'ll bring them back 15 years ago.What can I tell you more ? McDowell\\'s sets are amazing, Pescucci\\'s work is impressive as well as Rousselot\\'s beautiful cinematography. Some Oscar Nominations should fall here.As for the ending, without revealing it, August\\'s additions are really touching and fit perfectly to Burton\\'s new approach. Even though the final shot tempers the \"family\" theme that he developed through the film (it\\'s still Burton, not Disney), Burton makes you feel good because he feels good (and what I\\'m writing here will ring a bell when you\\'ll see the movie). I don\\'t know for you but after so many distressed and pessimistic films, it really moved to see that he found a certain peace. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is a step forward in the direction he gave to his career with Big Fish. He lost his father, he became one, he\\'s getting older and all those questions and doubts are expressed in many important and very complex images and scenes he imagined for the film. That\\'s why I could call this film the \"Edward Scissorhands\" of his new period. Those films are very different but gave me both some very essential emotions.Thank you, M.Burton. Thank you very much',\n",

How I wish he was still here today to have watched this glorious film with me.Baffled by many of the reviews saying to much Kaiju action or poor director etc.This film was clearly made by a dedicated and passionate Godzilla fan. The sheer amount of Easter eggs and fan service which had me grinning is incredible, (yet knowledgeable Godzilla fans on RT seem to not have noticed any of this) and talk about the likes of fire breathing dragons ><!Anyway the film is awesome. One of my favourite films of all time. Definitely my favourite Godzilla film.The effects are incredible.The music is awesome. You will be grinning from ear to ear at certain points.I actually like the human cast. I liked 2014 Godzilla but did not like the main cast Aaron Tailor Johnson. Did not have those issues here. They play imo a good supporting cast to the main cast you care about - The Titans :)!I'm super excited to see what happens next in the monsterverse.Make sure you stay till the VERY end of the credits scene or for a final scene hinting at wha could be to come ;)!I would also encourage you to write a review also should you watch and enjoy the film.

       " 'I\\'m a rare poster here at IMDb. Good movies? They get enough praise without me joining in the chorus. Average films? There\\'s usually enough people on each side to adequately debate the pros and cons. But a film this ridiculously bad has, if nothing else, crossed whichever threshold is required to motivate me to reset my long forgotten IMDb login details and hopefully save some poor souls the 90 odd minutes of their lives, and (god forbid) their hard earned on a ticket.It\\'s so hard to know where to begin, so, as a wiser person than me once suggested, I will begin at the beginning. The acting, from the get go, is so wooden, unbelievable and shallow that not only did I not feel any connection to the characters, they were actually making me angry! Keanu is has always been pretty one dimensional, but he takes it to a new level with his performance here. In this role as a supposedly doting father, it felt like he has never spent more than five minutes around any kid. The wife was equally unconvincing and the kids were so bad they wouldn\\'t get a role on a home-brand cola commercial. I did however quite like the Boston Terrier playing the role of the family pet, \\'Monkey\\', and I feel like he did his best to carry this stinker, but with limited screen time there was only so much he could do. Enter the 2 mysterious young women...who continue what has become the well established, by now 20 minute old tradition of corny, unconvincing Knock Knock performances.The direction is lousy. I\\'m no film buff, but I watch enough of them. When I saw Eli Roth was the director in the opening credits, I said to my wife \\'I think he has done some cool stuff\\'. Half way through this stinker I looked him up, and realised that, no...no he hasn\\'t done anything even remotely decent in his entire career. A bit of shock horror in Hostel, a tenuous claim to fame at best, and then nothing. And his lack of talent is glaringly obvious here. I think I had confused him with a hybrid of Tim Roth and possibly Elijah Wood? I dunno...but Eli Roth shall forever more be the huge red flag he rightly is. The story...let\\'s call it a \"story\" for the sake of this review anyway. There\\'s so much that could be said, so I\\'ll simply say that it sucked in ways that few things have ever sucked before. It pioneers new ways to suck that modern scientific research in sucking are yet to even discover. And the final cherry on this s#!t cake, was, after breaking my spirit and will to live, to break my heart to. Using the Pixies classic Where is My Mind as the closing track. Which the Pixies must have authorise...which defies comprehension. They made great money off their last tours, and allowed it to be used to close that all time classic Fight Club. And so ends my review of this diabolically bad film. If I save one person the price of a ticket, or an hour an a half of their precious existence, it\\'ll have all been worth it.',\n",
       " \"I'm one of those people who tend to think that South Korean movies are perhaps a bit too slow-paced for my taste. Memories of Murder isn't a fast-paced film, by any means, but this time the slow pace made this movie about an investigation of serial killings so much better than 95% of its American counterparts.Essentially, Memories of Murder is a drama first with thriller and comedy elements (yes, in the first hour or so the movie is actually quite funny). Kang-ho Song and Sang-kyung Kim are brilliant as the two cops who have drastically different views on how to solve a crime. The character development is fascinating and believable thanks to a great script.Highly recommended.\",\n",

       " \"Diluted pseudo-doc that leans heavily on ominous music and blurry photography to hint at awful activities on the Arizona/Mexico border. It tries to present itself as a hard hitting expose doc, complete with iconoclastic investigative reporter, but it's flat and lame because we know it's all phony and there isn't much success at suspending the sense of disbelief. When we finally get glimpses of what really happened it all looks very high school play, and you will roll your eyes in disappointment. The pic also tries to be a statement about US discrimination against Mexican immigrants but the analogy is a bit heavy handed and not very thoughtfully presented. All that aside, and that's a lot to try to put aside, this amateurish production commits the cardinal offense for a horror movie: it's not in the least bit scary and is deeply boring. My sense from the IMDb rating that suckered me into renting this is that it was logrolled by people involved in the production. I'm sure as more people see it and roll their eyes the rating will come down but in the meantime, don't make my mistake.\",\n",
       " 'THE IMPOSSIBLE (2012) The 2004 tsunami was one of the deadliest natural disasters on record. Because it occurred in the Christmas season and hit many resort area beaches its death toll of almost 250,000 was indiscriminate, taking not only South Asians but many visiting vacationers. People everywhere were affected by it. My own relatives who were then living in Thailand were destined that day to be on the beach, but, unknown to the rest of us, illness caused them to alter their plans. I personally heard from Thai acquaintances the story of nieces and nephews who excitedly ran to the shore to see the wondrous phenomenon of the receding ocean, only to be swamped by its return. Weeks later, flying over the Indonesian coastline, I could see with my own eyes just how far inland the wave had rushed, and the devastation it had wrought.How do you frame such a catastrophe in human terms, and present a situation of pure chaos in a way that makes a compelling story? How do you tell such a tale in a way that respects both the lost and the survivors, many of whom suffered personal tragedies as well, and more of whom bore the guilt of survival? How does one story tell some of the many stories of that day? These were among the challenges that faced director Juan Antonio Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Sanchez when they decided to put an account of the 2004 tsunami on the screen. Their solution was to deal with one British family on vacation in Thailand from Japan, but their film uses that family as a catalyst to show the tsunami\\'s awful effect not only on the tourist population but on the local people who suffered even more.Both the film itself and the filmmakers have taken pains to say that this is a \"true story,\" and they have aimed for the greatest possible authenticity in the circumstances. They have based themselves on detailed interviews with the family members and with other survivors, some of whom actually appear in the film. (For example, those who tell their tales to Ewan McGregor at the bus station are almost all actual survivors.) While footage of the tsunami strike itself was shot in a water tank at Alicante on the Spanish coast, and a couple of days filming of interiors took place in Spanish studios, the remainder of this picture was shot on location in Thailand using the real places of the story, such as the Orchid Beach Hotel in Phang Nga, and the actual hospital where much of the action occurs.The actual Thai locations and the many Thai actors keep the production values superb, and give this film an authenticity it would not otherwise have. So of course do the survivors who take part, whose emotions are sometimes all too real. Many video shots exist of the tsunami hitting the Asian beaches, but no one who was not there can have any real idea of what it must have been like to have been caught up by its waters. Bayona has chosen to focus not so much on the massive power of the tidal wave itself but on the sheer terror and disorientation it must have created for those submerged in it, and upon the human toll it took. But his scenes of its striking are horrific enough to give some sense of its magnitude, even on the screen. Nor does he pull his punches in some of the grisly scenes that follow. The impressive results that display both the striking wave and its terrible aftermath owe much to production designer Eugenio Caballero.The big names here are Ewan MacGregor as Henry and Naomi Watts as Maria, his doctor wife, while Geraldine Chaplin has a cameo role as a lady who comforts one of their sons on a starlit night. MacGregor and Watts seem to suit their parts, but in a sense they are playing predictable roles. They become a couple literally torn apart, a father having to search among the debris for the remainder of his family and a mother who for much of the picture hovers close to death. The family\\'s three sons are played by Tom Holland (Lucas), Samuel Joslin (Thomas) and Oaklee Pendergast (Simon). The two younger boys are cute as well as being effective, but that is not really a word that suits Tom Holland. The young British actor displays a surprising maturity and delivers a wonderfully measured performance, reminiscent of a younger Daniel Radcliffe. Despite the bigger names involved, it is his portrayal of Lucas that carries the picture since he is the hub around whom events revolve as the individual stories unfold. That is a lot to ask of a young actor, but Holland delivers.No one story can ever do justice to the events of that day and the days that followed. Nor can a story set in just one location ever capture just how wide-ranging were the tsunami\\'s effects. How can you tell the story of what happened almost simultaneously in Indonesia and India, Myanmar and Malaysia, and eventually affected even the African coast. Thankfully, Bayona doesn\\'t try. He focuses on the few, hoping that through them audiences will better understand the tale of the many. For such a story, The Impossible is perhaps a more than fitting title, but the film works and gives a view that is both visually impressive and dramatically moving.The Impossible premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2012. It will open in Spain on October 11, and go into general release in North America in the last week of December.Ray Lahey',\n",
       " \"Sure, I'm a huge film snob who (on the surface) only likes artsy-fartsy foreign films from before the 60's, but that hasn't stopped me from loving Disney's Beauty & The Beast; in fact, it's probably my favorite American animated film and is easily Disney's finest work. It's beautiful, it's breathtaking, it's warm, it's hilarious, it's captivating, and, in Disney fashion, it's magical. When I learned that Disney would be remaking their classic films, B&TB was undeniably the best wrapped package. How could they go wrong?Oh man, they went wrong.First thing's first: this film is so flat. The directing was dull and uninteresting throughout the entire film and it honestly felt like one of the Twilight sequels...and then I looked it up and found out that, yes, director Bill Condon was the man behind Breaking Dawn parts 1 & 2. Every shot looks bored and uninterested, which contrasts heavily with the original animated film that was constantly popping with vibrancy. The script too is boring because it's almost a complete remake of the original, though I guess most people won't mind that.Next: the CGI is horrid. Although I didn't care for The Jungle Book from last year, I could at least admit that the CGI was breathtaking. The same cant be said for this film. Characters like Lumière, Cogsworth, Mrs Potts, and most of the cursed appliances have very strange, lifeless faces that are pretty off putting to be looking at for such a long time. All of the sets too look artificial and fake, especially the town towards the beginning. However, the biggest offender is easily and infuriatingly the character that mattered most: The Beast. The CGI on the Beast's face is so distracting that it completely takes you out of the film. His eyes are completely devoid of soul, and his mouth is a gaping video game black hole of fiction. Klaus Kinski looked much better in the Faerie Tale Theatre episode of Beauty & The Beast, and that was a 1984 TV show episode. But do you know why it looked better? Because it was an actual face with actual eyes, not some video game computerized synthetic monstrosity. When will studios learn that practical effects will always top CGI?Finally: wasted casting. Emma Watson is beautiful, but she's no Belle. She is completely devoid of the warmth and humanity that made the animated Belle so beloved. Instead, she is cold and heartless throughout most of the film. Kevin Kline is 100% wasted and does nothing except look old. Ian McKellan, Ewan McGregor, Emma Thompson, and even Dan Stevens as the Beast are very expendable and could've been played by anyone else. The only good characters are Gaston and LeFou, mostly because they are fun and played by actors who breathe new life into their original shapes. If anything, this film should've been about Gaston and LeFou, but that would never happen because that would mean Disney couldn't cater to blind nostalgic 90's kids.Overall, this film is a complete bore. It could've been better if even the special effects were good, but the CGI in particular is horrendous. I'm all for Disney remaking their nostalgia- catering 90's films, but they need to be interesting. This film, sadly, is not. Even the Christmas sequel is better than this film because it's at least something.\",\n",
       " 'There\\'s the original version, released in 1986 and on videotape, and the 2002 Director\\'s Cut, available on DVD. The latter version is one of my all-time favorite movies. It compares quite favorably with Peter Jackson\\'s \"Lord of the Rings\" and is a modern classic.The theatrical release of 1986, shamefully butchered (chopped up and badly re-edited) by the mindless suits at Warner, and with its original Jerry Goldsmith score replaced by the rather trite Tangerine Dream soundtrack, is the version most people have seen. It was released on videotape as a children\\'s movie. What it is, and was intended to be, is a fairy tale for adults. In fact, it\\'s too intense for really young children.It\\'s hard to say that the \\'86 version deserves any more than the \"6\" it\\'s rated at on its IMDb main page. It is a disappointment, primarily because it\\'s now impossible to watch without think how much better it could be. The feeling and tone of the film were ruined by its treatment.The Ridley Scott Director\\'s Cut, released in 2002, is a completely different movie. If you haven\\'t seen this version, you haven\\'t seen the movie. It deserves a score of 9 or 10. It doesn\\'t look like a movie made 20 years ago. Scenes which are vital to the tone of the film and the meaning of the story have been restored. The sumptuous original soundtrack, recorded with a full orchestra, has also been restored, and this adds more to the film than can be put into words. About the performances: A very young Tom Cruise is excellent as the hero. Tim Curry as the Lord of Darkness is awesome; his costume and voice alone are worth the cost of renting or buying the DVD. Mia Sara is absolutely stunning as Lily. She actually plays two different versions of her character, both wonderfully.

       " 'When talking about war movies, there are many great ones that immediately spring to mind. Since the 70\\'s, three of them have formed a bit of a holy trinity: Francis Ford Coppola\\'s Apocalypse Now, Stanley Kubrick\\'s Full Metal Jacket, and Steven Spielberg\\'s Saving Private Ryan. These three movies have set the bar for all other war movies that have come along since then. When it was announced that Gladiator director, Ridley Scott, would be adapting Mark Bowden\\'s book, Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War, filmgoers knew that they would be in for a treat.For whatever reason, I don\\'t remember hearing much about the civil war in Somalia or about the Battle of Mogadishu on which Black Hawk Down is based. The plan seemed simple enough: the Army is sent into Somalia by the government to try to put an end to the Civil War. On October 3, 1993, a group of them were sent on a quick mission to capture the Somali warlord that had been running the country with an iron fist. It didn\\'t take long for the operation to go completely FUBAR as two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down. Things went from bad to worse, as the Rangers found themselves surrounded by thousands of armed Somalis, whose only goal was to shoot any American soldier that invaded their space. After \"stirring up the hornet\\'s nest\", the mission becomes a desperate attempt to maintain the Rangers motto, \"Leave No Man Behind\".Needless to say, Ridley Scott has made the ultimate war movie with Black Hawk Down. Unlike some war films that temper the battle with slower character-building sequences, you have to wait only thirty minutes for the Rangers\\' mission to go into effect. And the action doesn\\'t stop for the next two hours, as the rest of the movie is filled with flying bullets, explosions and bloodshed. The fighting is so chaotic that it is hard to follow the action and tell what is happening, at times, and it becomes almost too easy to become desensitized to the violence. By the third time someone yells \"RPG\\'s!\" though, the entire audience knows to duck and cover their ears.While the American soldiers go in with a solid plan, it doesn\\'t take long for panic to set in, and pretty soon, you\\'re not sure which side is more disorganized. It\\'s amazing to watch what seems like thousands of extras playing the Somali militia swarming over the soldiers, and the action and camerawork is reminiscent of a video game as the soldiers try to escape their precarious situation through the streets of Mogadishu. As the movie progresses, the tension continues to build as the grim and unrelenting hopelessness of the situation sets in both for the soldiers and the viewer.It\\'s pretty amazing how much has been made of the 19 downed American soldiers when over 1000 Somali men, women, and children were killed during the raid. While the movie is clearly weighed towards the American perspective, I can\\'t imagine how it must have felt to be the guy who gets to play \"Dead Somali with a Gun #354\".Although characterization has always been used extensively in war movies to get the viewer to care about the characters, Black Hawk Down works better because, for the most part, the soldiers are personified as little more than grunts in the field doing the bidding of their superiors. At least the soldiers had their names taped to their helmets, so that this didn\\'t have the problem of some war movies, where it\\'s sometimes hard to tell who is who. Some of the best performances of the film come from Tom Sizemore as the gung-ho Lt. McKnight and Josh Hartnett, who plays the sergeant who leads the mission and feels personal guilt every time a man is lost. Sam Shepard also is excellent as Major General William Garrison, who sits back in the safe zone watching his doomed men be overpowered by the enemy. Eric Bana\\'s part is small, but he has some of the best lines in the film, really driving home the point of why soldiers do what they do. Ewan McGregor\\'s role is even more minor and insignificant, but his Trainspotting compatriot, Ewen Bremner offers the movie\\'s little bit of comic relief.As expected in a Ridley Scott film, the visuals and camerawork are stunning with the movie having a gray almost monochromatic look that makes the orange flames and red blood really stand out. As is typical in Scott\\'s recent movies, there is lots of flying dust, rubble and debris mixed with slow motion shots of falling bullet casings and splattered blood. He also uses animals and non-military personnel well in some of the shots to show that this firefight is happening in the middle of a populated market district.A big deal has been made out of the blood and gore in Black Hawk Down, but what is any true war movie without it? Though most of the graphic violence on display is not far beyond Saving Private Ryan, there is at least one visceral sequence that will make most people squeamish, unless they watch those operation shows on The Learning Channel for entertainment. Black Hawk Down is quite an achievement in creating a realistic representation of an event in recent history. Most of this movie leaves the viewer aghast and incredulous of what they\\'re watching, and it\\'s hard to believe that something like this could possibly happen. Technically, this movie is an amazing feat that gives the viewer one of the most realistic impressions of what it would feel like to be in the middle of a war, which makes the atrocities of the event seem all the more real.In a genre that has brought out some of the best in directors and actors, Black Hawk Down is easily the best war movie ever made, and it has replaced A Beautiful Mind as my candidate for Best Picture and Director.Rating: 10 out of 10',\n",

       " 'A timeless story,as evidenced by all the allegories to recent personalities here ( Howard Stern, Clinton, etc...)...HOWEVER..the film is based (loosely) on a personality of the mid-50s: one Arthur Godfrey..yes, the IL\\' Redhead himself. Skillfully wrapped in the cliché of \\'country boy makes good\\' story, the Godfrey story was hot news in 1957,and there weren\\'t too many people back then who missed its allusions For those who do not know: Arthur Godfrey was one of THE hottest things in the country in the early to mid 1950\\'s: he literally had about two or three different TV shows on the schedule, plus a radio show that was among the most popular in the day. Godfrey was JUST like this movie in this respect: on the air, he was America\\'s home-spun hero..telling folksy stories....crooning in an off tone baritone, and presenting pure, CLEAN entertainment. OFF the air,however the legend that is Arthur Godfrey to this day is one of THE biggest control freaks in show biz history..to the point of controlling the lives of all of his \\'family\\'..unfortunately that turned out to be downfall...One Julius LaRosa had been a singer that Godfrey had \\'discovered\\' in the US Navy Band...after he was discharged LaRosa became a singer on Godfrey\\'s nighttime TV show \"Arthur Godfrey and Friends\",where he became an instant star among the bobby sox set. In time, LaRosa started a recording career,and started to have VERY successful records..then suddenly, in 1953, Godfrey suddenly fired LaRosa from his show for the mysterious reason of him having \\'no humilty\\' ...it has been assumed since then that Godfrey was extremely jealous of Larosa\\'s success...Anyways, this exposed the \\'real\\' Godfrey to the public.,and while it didn\\'t happen as quickly or as totally as Lonesome Rhodes\\' career,Godfrey\\'s career as a superstar was effectively over after that..he eventually was reduced to hosting game shows and such. Writer Schulberg obviously also puts in his 2 cents on fame...politics..the show business...and early television here, but as I said,there wasn\\'t NO ONE in those days who didn\\'t know it was about Godfrey....',\n",
       " \"Right from the opening credits, this film shows quality.  It stands above other comedies due to the lack of filler material - every line is memorable. The cast is great; the two leads make the most of their characters (both as brokers and bums) but never overstep the mark, thanks partly to the tight editing.  The plot becomes a little bizarre, but by that time you're already hooked, and the ending of the film is pure joy.  To my mind, no recent comedy has been this good; it mixes high and low brow jokes without resorting to toilet humour, it doesn't pull any punches (spot the social commentary), the performances are masterful and the script achieves depth without sacrificing the one-liners or slowing the pace.\",\n",
       " 'The year I was born was the same year Predator and Robocop came out. When I was finally old enough to appreciate films, Little Nicky was in theaters. I know, believe me, I know; rocky start. And often I would watch older films, or specials on older films, and be dazzled. You know the ones. Remember when they made Spartacus? Remember sitting in the movies and watching Gregory Peck play Atticus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird? Remember the first time you heard \"I could\\'ve been a contender\" through theater speakers? Well I sure as hell don\\'t. But I\\'ll tell you what, now I feel somewhat caught up. Let\\'s begin with the obvious. Daniel Day Lewis. No one\\'s arguing about this. The man is a veritable God among ants on the screen. He takes his role by the reigns and I don\\'t doubt him for a second. In fact, at times, I was downright afraid of the man. Lewis gives what is easily, EASILY the best performance of the past five years. But let\\'s get serious about it. Lewis\\' Daniel Plainview is the most convincing, awe-inspiring, and downright mortifying character to take the big screen that I can remember. Here, perfectly in his element and at his best, Lewis could go toe to toe with Brando and Kinski, playing a part that oozes enough skill and pathos to earn him a place among Hollywood\\'s, and perhaps the world\\'s, greatest performances of all time. He gives those of us who missed out on the craft, depth of character, and technique of classic cinema a chance to admire a tour de force portrayal of a memorable, identifiable, and completely despicable character, and it\\'s so damned refreshing that I can\\'t stop singing the man\\'s praises. Paul Dano has been taking a lot of fire for this whole thing. People continue to spout their disapproval of the film\\'s casting, saying that Dano has no business rivaling the seasoned Lewis on the screen. Listen, lay down your swords a minute and consider the obvious. The guy was cast opposite the performance of the decade, he\\'s not going to outshine Lewis and you\\'d be crazy to expect him to. In fact, I think that he and Lewis\\' back-and-forths are the films highlights, as we see the juxtaposition not only in the characters themselves, but also in their acting techniques. And the cinematography? Welcome to the old days of film. The glory days of Hollywood. Anderson gives us one of the most beautifully shot and directed films in recent memory, truly at the top of his craft on this one. Every moment feels more epic than the last, until the film becomes such a towering cinematic spectacle that the end leaves the viewer exhausted. It\\'s truly an experience not to be missed. Yeah, we missed out on A Street Car Named Desire. And Casablanca isn\\'t gonna be in theaters again any time soon. But in the meantime, There Will Be Blood is just about as good, and will likely haunt our generation as much as the Hollywood studio epics of the past...',\n",

       " \"What's worse than a leather-faced madman chasing you through the bush with a chainsaw? How about three!!`Wrong Turn' stars Desmond Harrington as Chris Finn, a man who is late for a very important interview. Finn takes a back country road to avoid a traffic jam and ends up involved in a car accident with three debutantes (Eliza Dushku, Lindy Booth and Emmanuelle Chriqui) and their boyfriends (Jeremy Sisto and Kevin Zegers). The group splits up as they try to find some help. Unbeknownst to them, they are being stalked by an unspeakable horror. Living in the woods around the crash is a family of cannibalistic mountain men who are overtly grotesque from generations of incest. Before the group knows it, they are in a fight for their very lives.`Wrong Turn' was in one word an utter shock to the system. There hasn't been a film this gory, grotesque and chilling in a very long time. Not since the 1970's `Texas Chainsaw Massacre' has a horror film such as this been made. The best way to describe the experience is that if you took 2001's `Joy Ride' and `Jeepers Creepers' added 1972's `Deliverance' then threw them all in a blender. You may come up with `Wrong Turn'.The tension in this film is harrowing and relentless as it bats you back and forth. You are exhausted and maybe even queasy when you come out of the theatre. But if you love horror films then you probably have an ear to ear grin as well.I really liked some of the early editing of this film by director Rob Schmidt, who allows the scares and shocks to come with brilliant accuracy. I also liked how Schmidt barely shows the mountain men throughout the film. The parts we do see are horrific but the filmmaker relies heavily on the chase and shock than on the gore. Schmidt could have easily dived down the gore shoot to hell but he made a wise choice that works in spades.It's the film's harrowing tension and atmospheric pursuit that overshadows the young stars that make up the cast. Dushku is strong and emulates some of her `Buffy the Vampire Slayer' character, Faith in her portrayal here. Dushku loves to play debutantes with edge and her character here has a lot of it. I wasn't extremely familiar with Desmond Harrington before this film but he plays a good leading man. The rest of the cast play typical generic 20-somethings from the horror film franchises of old. I have always liked Lindy Booth but she has nothing to play with here and the same is goes for Jeremy Sisto. But come on, this isn't exactly an intelligently written and detailed drama.I liked `Wrong Turn' purely because of its shock value and its no holds barred return to classic horror. It is always in your face and it doesn't let go till the credits. This film isn't for the faint of heart. What a rush! (3.5 out of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.\",\n",

You\\'d be wasting your time and miss something far too important.Hollywood does scale like nobody else, leaving the competition gasping in its wake. France does intimacy, and brutality. Nothing is sacred. And rather than try to revive the New Wave or emulate Hollywood like most widely seen French films of late, \"Intouchables\" harnesses its core strengths - ease with intimacy, willingness to ridicule anything and brutal honesty - and delivers one of the funniest, most honest and touching films I have ever seen.Sy is a failed robber, going through the motions and playing the stereotypical jobless émigré. Cluzet is a romantic and melancholy mind trapped in a useless body. The circumstances that bring them together are too funny to spoil here, but meet they do, and an awkward relationship quickly blossoms as they bring out the best in each other.The film\\'s simplicity is delightfully misleading: the script is a masterpiece of comedy writing, and however good the rest of the cast is, the central duo is magical. Sy\\'s comic timing will have you in stitches, but it is his honesty and vulnerability that make you fall in love with the character. Cluzet isn\\'t your typical sad-sack, instead, much of the finest pleasures in the film consist in watching him use his keen mind to mess with the world around him (a subplot about an abstract painting really takes the biscuit, you\\'ll know it when you see it).This is one of the most unique, beautiful and honest friendships ever committed to film.

It reminds me of so many conversations I\\'ve had with my friends. The situations and movie overall are pretty hilarious, with a few highly memorable parts.Lead actor Conor Sherry kills it.

       " '\"Shane\" should be required viewing for anyone setting out to make a film. It tells its story visually, through subtext, and creates a realistic portrait of people; it is also emotionally and morally complex.  It is never stated that Shane had been a gunfighter; we just understand this, from his appearance and from what we glean through the dialogue.  Likewise, there are no overt moments of intimacy between Shane and Marion (Mrs. Starrett), but we are aware that there is a deep attraction between them.  When Joe, Marian\\'s husband, realizes it, it is not because of anything he states, just a line at the 4th of July party, when Marian (in her wedding dress) is dancing with Shane:  \"Looks like I\\'m fenced out,\" and what is spoken as a joke becomes serious as we watch the expression on his face.  The closest he comes to actually saying anything is toward the end, when he\\'s going to ride into town to face Ryker, and tells Marian that if anything happens to him he knows she\\'ll be taken care of.  Likewise, at the end of the film, when little Joey is calling across the plains for Shane to \"come back,\" he yells to Shane, \"Mother wants you, I know she does,\" and the words echo back, we see a close up of Joey, his expression changing, and we know the child realizes too that Shane does (or could) mean something more to his mother.Stevens also didn\\'t make the \"bad guys\" black-and-white villains.  We understand that these men fought and tamed the land and are now being displaced by the homesteaders.  What they want might not be fair, but it is not completely unreasonable either.Most of the scenes, even the simple ones, play in montage.  It looks as though Stevens shot each scene from about 15 different angles and edited them together.  The effect is striking.Far and away one of the best films ever.',\n",

What results is nothing short of a fascinating product.All of the acting is very good. Malcolm McDowell plays psychotic villains so well, one can\\'t help but think he\\'s like that in real life.

But, I never could have imagined this...With this film, David Robert Mitchell has basically solidified his position as the world\\'s new Richard Kelly. IT FOLLOWS was his DONNIE DARKO, and THIS is his SOUTHLAND TALES. Southland Tales is the ONLY movie that I find this truly comparable to.First, it\\'s strengths: it is astronomically ambitious, unpredictable, and it will go WAY out of it\\'s way to try to be weird. You have to give anyone who is willing to go THAT FAR out on a limb a little bit of credit.

His portrayal of a smelly (people bring up how horrible he smells literally every 5 minutes throughout the film) timid weirdo is awkward in the wrong way - reminds me of Bradley Cooper in Silver Linings Playbook - you\\'re trying to be a weirdo but it\\'s not working - I see acting, I see trying. Then, he transforms into the Terminator in some really out-of-place sequences that would be really cool if they didn\\'t make such little sense in their placement. Second, this is a movie about Los Angeles that feels like it was made by someone who only knows as much as tourists know about Los Angeles. The locations are all the most cliche L.A. staples, which serve their purpose, but the majority of the characters feel like ignorant caricatures of what outsiders think L.A. people are like: yoga hippies, music producers, prostitutes, but all depthless interpretations with no inspiration - there is one specific \"L.A. party\" sequence on a downtown rooftop full of bland L.A. actors trying to portray eccentric L.A. people and it\\'s so off base it feels like a rejected Target commercial.It\\'s clear that this movie wants to be Mulholland Drive, but it lacks the conceptual focus, the effective dreamlike surrealism, and the palpable creativity that make that film so masterful.

       " 'Late in the film, King Arthur is about to fight his last battle against his estranged son Mordred. His kingdom of Camelot is falling. The knights of the Round Table are disbanding. Guinevere has entered a convent. In short, Arthur\\'s world is collapsing. He rides to the nunnery to see Guinevere for the last time. And there, she produces the ancient timeless object hidden beneath some linen: the sword Excalibur, still gleaming, still magical, still potent to fight in the battle that Arthur cannot win. He sheathes Excalibur, and, in full knightly regalia rides with his remaining loyal knights through the English countryside, their pennants and banners flying in the wind. The fortissimo chorus of Carmina Burana accompanies their ride in perfect harmony, chanting the lyrics from the medieval poem \"O Fortuna\". This is the stuff of legend...Artistic treatments of the Arthurian legends date back to illuminated codices from the Middle Ages. Thereafter the first, and one of the greatest, attempts to bring the stories into a novelistic form was written in the late 1400\\'s by a knight, Sir Thomas Malory, entitled La Morte d\\'Arthur (\"The Death of Arthur\") which is probably the most famous work of English letters proceeding Chaucer but before Shakespeare. Even later renditions include T.H. White\\'s \"The Once and Future King\". By the 20th century, theatrical adaptations began appearing as well, including \"Knights of the Round Table\" (1953), Disney\\'s \"The Sword in the Stone\" (1963), and the musical \"Camelot\" by Lerner and Lowe which was possibly the most popular rendition of the story before \"Excalibur\". These last renditions, although they have their appeal, cannot measure up to the movie \"Excalibur\" which was largely based upon Malory\\'s original tome.Many here have detailed very well the merits of the film, and since most people know the story, I will keep this short. The reason why this is the best of the Arthurian-based films is its imagery and its dedication to the original Arthurian myths. The entire look of the film, which I have not seen in a movie since, reeks of Medieval Legend. The lush forests, the huge castles, and the glittering swords give a visual and dream-like reality. This is NOT how it was in the Middle Ages. This is how people in the Middle Ages would have liked it to have been, which is the entire point of the Arthurian myths. The filmmakers of Excalibur understood that myth is about dreams.Several moments in the film are inspired directly from Malory and earlier Medieval codices. For example, several Medieval illuminated manuscripts feature the hand of the Lady of the Lake bestowing the sword Excalibur to Arthur. Strangely this episode, which becomes an important theme throughout Excalibur, is lacking from other theatrical versions and yet it is central to the original myth. Another is the strange rhetoric that Arthur and the land are one, and when Arthur becomes ill, the land of his kingdom becomes barren. This concept was a widely held belief in the Middle Ages: that the sovereign was essentially married to the kingdom.Another aspect that makes this film outstanding is the portrayal of Merlin by Nicol Williamson. This was possibly the best Merlin ever to come to the large screen. Some of the most humorous moments of the film occur with Merlin. Instead of being the absent-minded wizard of \"The Sword in the Stone\", he is the last of the Druids, a race giving way to Medieval Christians. Worth the price of admission. It is sad that he obtained very little recognition for this portrayal.The fact is, a viewer either experiences \"aesthetic arrest\" with Excalibur, or he or she doesn\\'t. If the scenes when the knights go riding through countryside with their pennants flying behind them doesn\\'t give you the shivers, this is not and will never be your kind of movie. If Malory had lived to see this film, he would have been awed and proud. Malory gave Arthur to the world, and Excalibur gave Arthur back to Malory.',\n",

I got a kick out of the big basketball game, and found the sequence with Bugs and Daffy retrieving Michael's lucky boxers to be a riot.  Yea, the plot is pretty hare-brained ('scuse me, Bugs...duck-brained;D), but it's nothing unworthy of Looney Tunes.  Don't ever forget that-this is a Looney Tunes film.  They got away with using anything for a plot, and this movie is in the same tradition.  It's like asking a movie about Beavis and Butthead to be artful and dramatic.  Looney Tunes represent the goofy side of animation, and this film adheres well to that philosophy.  I recommend this for any fan of Looney Tunes...oh yea, if your a sports fan, you should enjoy it too.  I, a mild basketball fan, really enjoyed myself.\",\n",
       " \"Remember Bugsy Malone? That gangster film where all the characters were kids?Well, The Irishman is a gangster film where all the characters are geriatrics. At the start of the film, De Niro's CGI youthened character still looked like he's 50. They all do. They're old, fat, hunched, liver-spotted killers, even when they're supposedly young(er). It's weird.The film just drags on and on and never really gets going. The plot is disjointed and never really tells a story or builds a narrative. Unlike Scorsese's classics like Casino or Goodfellas, this film really struggles to develop a story worth watching.3.5 hours. $160M budget. Good Lord. At least this rubbish will be 'free' on Netflix soon. There's a reason no one else wanted it - it wasn't going to make any money at the cinema. Even the $13 you pay for Netflix is too much for this film.\",\n",
       " 'I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers\\' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don\\'t know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.\\nIt is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW\\'s were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant\\'s uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW\\'s built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn\\'t fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW\\'s wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW\\'s participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it\\'s true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio\\'s bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see \"Hart\\'s War\" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).All in all, \"The Great Escape\" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It\\'s well worth the time.',\n",
       " 'When \"Coherence\" debuted this summer, it earned very, very little money. So far, since its release in June, this independent film has earned less than $69,000. So it\\'s very, very likely a film you haven\\'t yet seen. As for me, I am actually very thankful I didn\\'t see it in the theater-- and it\\'s for a reason you might not anticipate. It\\'s not because the plot is bad (it\\'s kind of interesting actually) but because the film has horrendous camera-work. I assume that the camera-work is supposed to be hip or exciting--but to me it is nausea-evoking and if I\\'d seen it on the big screen, I probably would have gotten a headache or begun vomiting. This is because the entire movie has a hand-held camera look and the picture almost never stays still. It almost always bounces around and won\\'t stay on any one object. Now this might work for a very limited number of films--such as a \\'found footage\\' film like The Blair Witch Project. So why, then, does the camera keep moving with a film like Coherence? And, why are some of the edits (particularly early in the film) so seemingly random and some shots out of focus? If you see it, you might just want to take a few Dramamine in order to cope with the camera\\'s movement--which I expect with home movies but not with a film lasting nearly 90 minutes. Can the movie itself manage to overcome this annoying camera-work and make it all worthwhile?\"Coherence\" is set during a dinner party where lots of disparate friends have come together for a nice evening of food and conversation. This occurs during a time when a comet has come very close to the Earth. Inexplicably, it seems to be causing some strange phenomena--such as cell phones which shatter and an internet which no longer functions during the course of their evening. However, the weird happenings get far weirder and the film begins to look a lot like The Twilight Zone-- especially like one of my very favorite episodes, The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street. Not surprisingly, the guests all begin to freak out and paranoia and fear begin to grip them. What, exactly, do they experience? See the movie if you want to know.The film turns out to have some positive things going for it. The story is quite creepy and its creepiness is heightened by the music and mood-- and it gets creepier as the film progresses. With better camera-work, it really would have had a lot more chance to work. Now this isn\\'t saying that the script is perfect. A few of the friends at the party are a bit broadly written and annoying--and you question why the other people would associate with them (such as the lady who is into mysticism and the \\'funny guy\\'). But the story is a good example of making the most of a simple idea and setting.For me, the camera-work was unfortunately a deal-breaker. In other words, it was so bad that it really ruined the film. However, I should point out that if you read the reviews on IMDb, you\\'ll find the film has two extreme reactions for the viewers--they either really liked it a lot and didn\\'t seem bothered by the awful technical aspects of the film or they hated it. There really aren\\'t too many reviewers with neutral views on the film--it has a truly bi-modal distribution for all you statistics freaks out there. You\\'ll apparently love it or hate it. With better and more professional looking camera-work, I might have been in the former group. But, as it is, I just cannot recommend it. I should point out, however, that there are parts of the film that show the filmmakers have promise and I would like to see more of their work in the future provided they do something about the film technique they use---please, no more camera-work that looks like it was done by attaching a mini-cam to a dog or cat!',\n",
       " 'Rating: **** out of ****My opinion of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade could be deemed slightly biased. It is the first film I ever saw in theaters and it\\'s also the first movie I purchased on video. I even own the same, worn-down, beat-up copy (and look upon it even more fondly than the widescreen edition, for sentimental reasons, of course) (but nothing beats the pristine quality DVD). I think it\\'s fair to say it\\'s this movie that cemented my love of cinema, the high regard I hold for great escapism, which is sorely lacking from today\\'s cinema; movies that should be fun now drag or bludgeon themselves with relentlessly awful scripts or MTV-style direction that turns relatively simple scenes into chaotic blurs. The Last Crusade may only be thirteen years old, but I think I can safely say they don\\'t make them like they used to.The film stars, of course, Harrison Ford as Indy Jones, the archaeologist/adventurer who\\'s on yet another quest, this time to find his father, who\\'d been searching for the Holy Grail. Said Dad is played by none other than Sean Connery, whose highly charismatic performance is quick to place this film, acting-wise, above the others in the trilogy by giving Ford a genuine acting equal (let me put it this way, he\\'s only half a notch below Harrison Ford/Indy in charisma and appeal if that tells you anything). The rest of the film focuses on this ongoing journey between father and son (eventually joined along by Sallah and Marcus Brody), complete with amazing action and stunt sequences, clever humor, and nasty (but fun) surprises.The script, by Jeffrey Boam, takes a few cues from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but actually improves upon that story by paying more attention to characterization. The delightful opening scene (all three movies really open with a bang, don\\'t they?); which details how young Indy got his scar, whip, hat, and fear of snakes; makes for a better prequel than Temple of Doom (and any of The Adventure of Young Indiana Jones, for that matter).The story is engrossing because there\\'s a lot of fun clues offered towards the location of the Grail and, thus, there\\'s a lot of engaging little discoveries (love the \"X marks the spot\" scene). I\\'m quite certain, like with Raiders of the Lost Ark, the plot has a few holes, but they\\'re fairly hard to notice, and I\\'ve seen this movie quite a few times, but maybe it\\'s just my enjoyment of the film clouding that up. Either way, it speaks volumes in favor of Spielberg\\'s direction and the performances.Given that action and adventure is the series\\' selling point, you can expect the thrills and wondrous delight of discovery delivered in spades. The action scenes are terrific (and matched well with John Williams\\' rousing, memorable score, also the best of the trilogy), the best being a fantastic ten-minute chase sequence on board (and in) a tank, possibly the best action sequence of Spielberg\\'s career. I also loved the motorcycle chase and the Zeppelin setpiece, where the heroes go about dispatching of two enemy fighters in unexpected, but quite hilarious, fashion. The climax, complete with frightening booby traps, is a suspenseful venture into the unknown.The Last Crusade is far more humor-oriented than its predecessors, but part of the movie\\'s effectiveness is that it\\'s able to deliver belly laughs without defusing the tension during the action sequences. Some of the jokes are just brilliant, including one with Indy armed with a Luger in confrontation with a trio of Nazis on board a tank that\\'s even funnier than the swordsman scene in Raiders (well, to me, at least).The supporting cast is all-around superb; John Rhys-Davies is back as Sallah, wonderful as ever and displaying a bit more enthusiasm searching for the Grail than he did digging up the Ark of the Covenant. The late Denholm Elliot also returns as Marcus Brody, the most lovable goof of a museum curator. Alison Doody is interesting as Elsa, the blonde historian whom Indy falls for; a twist involving her character and her actions towards the climax make her not as one-dimensional as she may initially appear. Julian Glover is the best of the main Indy villains, he\\'s far more menacing than Paul Freeman\\'s Belloq and less over-the-top but equally enjoyable as Amrish Pruri\\'s Mola Ram. I also enjoyed Michael Byrne\\'s performance as the Jones hating Colonel Vogel, who relishes in torturing Indy and his father. When it comes to pure delightfully nasty villainy, Byrne is even more fun to watch than Glover.Harrison Ford delivers his best Indy performance (maybe even his best performance, period) in this particular adventure. With the addition of Connery as his father, it reveals a personal side to Indy we haven\\'t seen before. It\\'s his rapport with Connery that separates this film from the rest of the genre. They craft an uncannily touching, funny, and genuine bond. That, coupled with the superb action and thrills, solidifies The Last Crusade as the pinnacle of high adventure summer entertainment.',\n",
       " 'This movie is an absolutely wonderful fantasy. I totally loved it.The dialog is brilliant. The humor is both bold, and subtle. The characters are archetypal.Matilda perfectly captures what it is like to be an intelligent person, trapped in the body of a child, and surrounded by idiots who control far too much of your life.The notion that bad people (even adults) deserve to be punished for their evil ways (even by children) is truly subversive. Any child who suffered through the countless typical abuses of unthinking, uncaring, and ignorant parents will truly love this movie. Those same unthinking, uncaring, and ignorant parents will probably hate this movie, unless they are wise enough to see the truth behind the fantasy.Despite the difficulties Matilda faces, like all good fantasies this movie has a wonderfully happy ending. I wish the same for all.',\n",
       " \"This is a classic fantasy film from Jim Henson, in collaboration with George Lucas. There really is a magic about the film and that has helped it last as a firm family favourite all these years. As with many films aimed at younger audiences there are messages that the writers, in this case Henson himself, have tried to convey, such as `be careful what you wish for (as in the heat of the moment we are not always sure what is best for us) and also about not taking things for granted. These lessons not only relate to the major target audience of young children but also teenagers and adults alike. The film also has values and attitudes about growing up, the central character Sarah is in the awkward stage between child and womanhood, the stage of adolescence. She acts like a child in her self importance and possessiveness but she is perhaps starting to grow out of her young imagination. She does not want to, her room full of inanimate companions, dreams and fantasies, she feels are slipping away.Labyrinth is about Sarah keeping her imagination alive, her fantasies and dreams, and these help her figure out what she is doing wrong, it helps her realise how her attitude is wrong and causes her to be depressed. There is certainly intelligence to this film if analysed deeply. There is depth to the script, and clear attitudes and values that Jim Henson conveys. Henson is in a way telling not just kids, but also adults, that our subconscious, which includes our dreams and imaginative side (in terms of taking yourself to another place, more than imagination in creating something like a piece of music for instance.) can be as affective a guide to where and when your live is going wrong as your conscious. Sometimes we don't realise things we have said or done until we dream. How many times have you said something, that every teen must have to their parents, for instance `I wish you were dead', very cruel but it is said. I have in the past and realised the full implication in a bad dream, a dream is the most effective doorway to imagine something outside of it really happening. What is fantastic about the way the film opens and closes as that it really hints to the fact that Sarah has been through the same dream before, and that she needs these imaginative friends, and dreams to help her see the light as it were. She says for instance at the close that every now and again she needs Hoggle and company. The opening of the film sees Sarah reciting from a book to herself, she is addressing the Goblin king and the characters of this book and her room are the cast of a play inside her mind, they are special to her and meaningful, in a way we might have a favourite song that speaks to us in some way. At the start of the film when we are first in her room there is clever use of visual hints that you wouldn't pick up on until watching a film the second time. Look around her room and you see the characters everywhere, Hoggle, Ludo even a little replica of a maze. There is also a clipping of Sarah's mother, who we do not know whether she is still alive, but in any case is not around, but she is with a man who is the likeness of the Goblin King. The man in the photo probably a figure of blame for the loss (however large) of Sarah's mother. What is also interesting is Sarah being a young girl at the start of puberty has a certain fascination and perhaps crush on the Goblin King, perhaps a combination of the character from the book and the likeness of which she has created this character in her head. Certainly on a visual and script basis there are some clever touches when you consider this is a kids film. The film itself is much like the Wizard of Oz in terms of story (intentional maybe as it could represent something that Sarah finds special and perhaps inspirational). What I really love about the film is, that before the days of CGI, inside the Goblin world, which accounts for 90% of the film, everything is 100% set work, there must be well over a hundred sets and they are all imaginative an create the enchanting atmosphere of the film, these sets combined with some fantastic matte paintings from ILM that give even more of a scale to the film.I do really like this film, the look, the cheesy feel good 80's music, the characters, it is all great. There is some good humour and of course the odd piece of very childish low brow humour but that is to be expected. It is movie magic no question. David Bowie is good as the Goblin King and all the puppeted characters are fantastically brought to life in there movements and voicing as you would expect from a Henson film. A very youthful Jennifer Connelly before the days when many a website was devoted to her ample bosom, has a charm to her, she has to hold the movie together and win the audience, especially after being very bratty and effectively wishing her baby brother into the clutches of Goblins. She does manage to win the audience though and enchant them with her green eyes and youthful innocence.This film is great, it is what makes, or made fantasy films of this time really enchanting. Real artistry was involved, there was exuberance and charm to it and it has lasted a long time. It is a firm fans favourite and still gains new young fans. I can still to this day sit down and enjoy the film because I remember what Jim Henson tries to teach us. `Keep the inner child alive inside you sometimes he/she actually knows best'. Perhaps certain events in recent years may have panned out differently had this been heeded by more people, but that is all just hear say.Overall this is a classic fantasy film with much artistry and charm to appreciate, certainly Henson had a skill in all his fields in the industry. ****\",\n",
       " 'I had really enjoyed \"Falling\" as well, Viggo Mortensen\\'s directorial debut, but this film is a step up. It admittedly does not target as heavy a subject as his previous film, but it is written, directed, and acted (by the whole cast, especially the leading actors) beautifully. The cinematography and music are really thoughtfully put together as well, and do a good job capturing the 19th century look, without coming across as contrived. Glad to see Viggo going from strength to strength. I hope the film is recognized for the great work it is. Fun to get a glimpse of Anduril as well :) Highly recommended.',\n",
       " \"Rating: 2.3\\nOverall, a complete misfiring on all cylinders as everything in this movie is so bad that is borderline camp on New England culture, making it a must watch to see how something this terrible got made into a movie.Terrible Direction (Has no control over any part of this movie; the movie is terrible on a macro-scale it feels very formulaic and any other movie from New England (but clashed with a forced drug trafficking storyline); the movie is Terrible on a micro-scale because there is absolutely no chemistry in the entire cast (really does not help his actors in any way) and the scenes just feel forced and choppy; the storytelling is terrible because everything just feels choppy and forced (with nothing feeling like it is happening for a reason)), Terrible to Very Bad Acting (Very Bad from Ben Foster (He feels so over-the-top that it is comical and he has no chemistry with any of the other characters (and is just so shelved off)), Terrible from Toby Wallace (Just terrible all around as he is not convincing as the lead and just forces himself into every conversation and situation somewhat in a Deus Ex Machina way; so over-the-top that he is funny when he is meant to be serious and boring when he is meant to be funny; Has zero chemistry with Ben Foster and somehow negative chemistry with Jenna Ortega), Very Bad from Jenna Ortega (Incredibly forced and unnecessary as her interjections really have nothing to do with what is going on and she clearly hits a ceiling when it comes to the dramatic points; the deadpan moments when it comes to the comedic parts does not work with the rest of the cast; has negative chemistry with Toby Wallace because it just feels forced and rushed), Bad from Tommy Lee Jones (Plays himself giving no effort as his experience can only take him so far given how bad the script is (and it seems like he knows how bad the movie is and just wants to finish the job); at least elevates the scenes he is in (but by a marginal amount)), Terrible from the rest of the cast (Just inexperience all around and terrible/unconvincing acting from people in this area/profession; no chemistry in the entire cast whatsoever)), Terrible Story (The concept was somewhat personal to the director but the overall story was horribly constructed as there just feels like there is no vision for what he is going for (just does a terrible job at clashing two different ideas into one); the story construction was poor because the conflict is introduced at the 1-hour 15-minute mark of a 2-hour movie, prioritizing a poorly written exposition that leaves for very little rising action and a rushed climax(could have cut like 20-30 minutes of the exposition and would have gotten the same film); the flow between sequences is just so forced and on a grand scheme makes no sense (especially in the shift in plot for the conflict; the characters are just so shallowly written that you don't really care for them or what they are going through (and it doesn't help that they do not have any chemistry, especially the relationship between Wallace and Ortega's characters as its just so rushed and forced), Terrible Screenplay (The dialogue just is so unnatural and incredibly stupid that it is very campy (it is impossible to think that people talk this way and the amount they repeat the word 'Finestkind' is laughable); the jokes are just so bad and sad at how bad they hit (like when Jenna Ortega's character calls the main character 'White Boy' when no aspects of her race/identity are ever mentioned in the movie; there is practically no symbolism as every metaphor they introduce is forced to the point that the message makes no sense and not believable; there is no foreshadowing (the movie just so shallow that hooks left at the beginning of the movie just make the story so predictable), Decent Score, Very Bad Cinematography (So bad that it honestly felt nauseating at times; the handy-cam moments were just too shaky and the polished moments cut way too many times that it felt amateurish; over-used the of shot-reverse shot technique that it made me madder than focus on the characters in frame), Decent Sound (Just felt like that of a standard action movie), Very Bad Editing (The sequences are so so sharply edited that it felt like there is no sense of continuity they were going for (and it feels amateurish too)), Decent Visual Effects (Mostly practical effects), Plot Structure was terrible because the movie spends too much time on the exposition (and does a bad job at that too) to where the conflict is introduced so late in the movie that there is no room to develop a rising action (and the climax suffers because of it because it feels rushed and forced), Pacing is a mess because it is incredibly fast in going through plot points (but there is just so much meanless plot that that it somewhat feels slow at the same time), Climax is incredibly rushed and feels incredibly out of place (and it just feels like a child directed it), Tone feels like a generic Boston 'Dad' movie but making the movie a drug trafficking thriller just completely shifts the tone in a 180 fashion (and nothing prepares for this), Saw a premiere at Austin Film Fest.\",\n",
       " 'Someone said that this movie was too cerebral for horror fans who live for drivel like \"From Dusk \\'Till Dawn\", and too much of a horror movie for people who look (or at least pretend to look) for meaning in movies -- pseudo-intellectuals. That person couldn\\'t have been more correct. I\\'m not a horror fan, I\\'m not an Anne Rice fan...I\\'m not even fond of Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, and Antonio Banderas. But Interview With a Vampire was a movie that excelled my expectations.I refused to see this film for 3 years because I believed it would be what I perceived it to be: glitzy Hollywood garbage geared toward adolescent girls with posters of the 3 main actors all over their walls. I finally broke down and rented it, and I was astonished by the incredible performances delivered, the thrilling dialogue and the way it was delivered by the actors, the scenery, the plot, the score...everything. I never thought that Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise could act, but their performances made their unbelievable characters a reality. However, the true star of the film was Kirsten Dunst. At 12 years old, this girl was able to hold her own against her co-stars, and often stole the scene (particularly the incident in which Claudia tries to cut her hair and subsequently Lestat discovers the corpse in her bed.)You don\\'t want to look for the meaning of life in this movie. It\\'s a story. The plot is basically the history of a vampire\\'s life, and I don\\'t understand why people are compelled to trash a movie because of its simplicity. Look at the title. That\\'s all it is, and if you expect more you\\'re setting yourself up for disappointment. It\\'s not the deepest of movies, that\\'s why it should be enjoyed for the intense dialogue and the great production that went into it. Others trash the movie because of its homoerotic undertones. This aspect is so fleeting that it\\'s ridiculous to dwell on it, and if you dwell on such an insignificant aspect of the movie then you were obviously looking for something to bother you. One additional thing: to even suggest that the violence in this film could be responsible for incidents such as the Columbine High School killings is beyond moronic.This isn\\'t the greatest movie that has ever been made, it\\'s certainly not a complex analysis of life, or a parable with a moral dictating the enjoyment of life. It\\'s a brilliantly produced gothic tale of a vampire, nothing more and nothing less. In respect to the book, I\\'ve never read it and I don\\'t particularly care to read it.

This movie is also pretty ambitious - there\\'s a hell of a lot going on throughout this whole film, but they find a great way to balance all of the different angles going on, without overloading you at any time. Versatile is the word that comes to mind...let\\'s run through the main points:Pros: Great casting, and solid acting. Don\\'t expect any nominations, but it seems that every character has just the right actor for the job. Aaron Traylor-Johnson has clearly put a lot of work into this, because it looks like he\\'s been working out with Chris Hemsworth and the rest of the Avengers. Chloë Grace Moretz is the perfect \"Hit-Girl\". Christopher Mintz-Plasse nails his character. Jim Carrey is great. John Leguizamo is in this! That guy deserves more work. And the movie deserves an award just for even coming up with a character named \"Mother Russia\". ACTION SEQUENCES. The 1st movie executed these to perfection, and the sequel follows suit. A great mix of high-level, slightly over-the-top martial arts action, lower-level brawling fights, gun play, high-speed chases, and even some explosions! And the soundtrack for these sequences deserves a mention. (When you have the previously-mentioned \"Mother Russia\" on a rampage, and a remix of the damn theme song from \"Tetris\" is playing in the background...you\\'ve won.) This movie is damn funny. You will laugh. Surprisingly emotional! There are a few scenes here and there that might just pull a heart string...they don\\'t feel overly cheezy, and fit right in with the story...even the \"Mean Girls\" scenes.Cons: ........ ***thinking hard*** ...if I had to nit-pick, I could say that the movie almost goes too fast through a pretty major part. The movie is pretty fast paced throughout, but it might feel like a particular event may have deserved a bit more time to dwell on. Jim Carrey and John Leguizamo could have been utilized more. They were both great, but with so much going on here, it may have been tough to squeeze an extra scene or two for them.Now, the inevitable comparison: how does it compare to the original? If I had to make a choice, I\\'ve got the take the original over this one. That\\'s not a knock on this sequel - it\\'s very worthy of the franchise. But the original was so epic, that matching it was always going to be a challenge. I\\'ll say this though...the sequel comes pretty damn close, and which one you prefer may easily be different from my choice.Overall, this is a damn good time at the movies...dammit.

I read them after the I'd seen the film and thought that I must have inadvertently gone into the wrong screening and watched a different film. The film I watched turned out to be an overblown (at least 30 minutes too long) stylised, pretentious piece of nonsense only saved by three great actresses at the absolute peak of their powers. The soundtrack was as irritating as it was superfluous and the foul language as gratuitous as it was unnecessary. I thought that maybe my response was because I didn't get it, being English and familiar with this type of film, but I saw the film in the US and the mood of the audience throughout and especially upon the ridiculous ending was almost unanimously negative - and volubly so. I realise that in terms of reviews I appear to be in a tiny, tiny minority but if I can save one person from wasting their money on this film my work will have been done.\",\n",

       " \"The story of how World War Z was made is a lot more harrowing and suspenseful than the film itself. After going way over-budget and enduing a complete revision and reshoot of the final act, WWZ wasn't exactly set up for success. Ultimately the movie is completely forgettable and uneven, but not offensively bad or objectively terrible in any sense. What struck me about it was how much of a wasted opportunity it was, given how interesting and entertaining the source material is.Having read the book World War Z, I could tell from the trailers for this movie that it wouldn't exactly be a faithful adaptation. I thought that the most interesting aspects of the book were its exploration of how the Zombie plague affected social and political structures across the world. Anything like that is completely ignored in the film, but I can at least understand how the filmmakers thought that those aspects wouldn't work in a single feature length movie. What I can't understand is how the filmmakers seemingly ignored the book's most obviously cinematic content. The book features a lot of setpiece action scenes, and to be fair, many of these involve world cities falling to zombie infestation and the movie does do enough to cover this. However, the book's immense battle scenes - the meat of the titular Zombie War, such as the Battle of Yonkers, nuclear war between Pakistan and Iran, Chinese civil war and massive formation combat against zombies - are completely absent. I was very surprised that they did not cover these, especially the Yonkers scene, because they would obviously fit so well into a film and the script, even as it is now, could easily be tweaked to include or at least mention them. The action that did make it into this film is very unsatisfying and obscure thanks to the restrictions of the PG-13 rating, and the narrative around is not engaging enough to really get me invested in it.I was also surprised at how cheap this movie looked. This film cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make, but it's hard to see where it all went on the screen. Swarms of zombies look very fake and nonthreatening, and in some cases individual zombies are computer animated, which gave me bad flashbacks to I Am Legend's awful CGI overload. Aside from the opening scenes in Philadelphia and the middle act in Jerusalem, there are no big outdoor sets. A South Korean airbase is portrayed as a series of dark rooms; too much of the movie takes place in an airline seat; there is a lot of sitting around inside of the aircraft carrier, etc. The sense of scale is very inconsistent, and this is accentuated in the bizarre final act, which was obviously the focus of the infamous reshoots as it feels like a completely separate movie. I consider myself a patient viewer, but this very long and dull scene started to bring me down after a while, and my less patient viewing audience eventually fell completely out of sync with the film and began to make fun of it at every opportunity - not really a fair criticism of the film, but it's a real issue when it can't hold an audience's attention. The final act does actually have an interesting idea at its heart, albeit one that completely doesn't connect with anything in the book, but I just didn't think it was a well executed concept. The very different style and tone of these scenes makes it feel like a completely different movie.Again, while there was nothing all that terrible about WWZ, I didn't think it was anything to get excited about. In other words, a perfect 5/10 movie. I wish they were more aware of the source material's potential because without the best and most cinematic aspects of the book, WWZ (the film)and WWZ (the book) only share a title and the central premise of a zombie plague, which is not an original idea in itself.\",\n",
       " \"The plot for this is silly but workable and takes a swipe at the manufactured state of modern life in the spotlight.Ironically this film suffers from the aliments it pokes fun at.The garish product placement, the awkward tokenism, the forced one-liners, promotional music videos, and relentless social commentary drains the warmth from this movie, making it feel contrived in a very clinical way.The characters feel like they rolled off the Role-model Factory: safe, sterile and dull. I didn't care about them at all.Both are self-sufficient individuals who don't need each other beyond the superficial - one is happy in her ivory tower of wealth the other content in his smug self-righteousness - so they might as well go their own ways.Jennifer's character is always in complete control of every situation, she always looks flawless and is propped up by immense material resources allowing herself to buy her way out of any situation, any issue she has is really only a minor inconvenience that will pass - making her hard to relate to.Owen Wilson plays himself as usual, his character is very plain, which is ok. But again he has everything he ever wanted, apart from his daughter's admiration, which is quite easily purchased.Whereas Julia Roberts was - just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her.Jennifer Lopez is - just a woman, working in an industry that marginalises women, asking a man to rewrite a patriarchal narrative so she can show her social media audience she is strong and independent.Whether you agree with that sentiment or not is one thing, but it certainly isn't romantic or comedic.\",\n",

       " \"Take the hottest day of the year, a traffic gridlock, cracked pavements, dirty streets, unwarranted hostility and a general feeling of being short changed. Then add the frustrations of having an estranged wife and child, an extremely jaded and unbalanced mindset, and the frustration of being obsolete with no marketable skills. Set them against the decadent back drop of modern day LA where if you are 'Not economically viable,' you are of no use, and the result is Falling Down.The tag line 'The Adventures of an Ordinary man at War with the Everyday World,' makes Joel Schumacher's masterpiece sound like the benign story of a working stiff with issues. However Falling Down is a dark and engrossing urban fable, a study into the mind of the disenfranchised and reminder to all that the removal of comfort is a lot closer than we care to believe.Full of clichés, like the cop on his last day before retiring, Falling Down bravely meets all expectations of stereotypes, rather than challenging them, making for a realistic reflection of a failing society. Here, a man in extremis, without the feral cunning or killer instinct required for a life in the street, makes his way on anger and luck alone, somehow surviving to leave a paper chase of violence and destruction behind.Relying heavily on symbolism, illustrating a flip side of America running parallel to the hunky dory world occupied by the successful, the over all message of 'No Matter, Never Mind,' is clear in this world where children play next to vagrants dying from AIDS and Korean grocers can legally steal from the public with their overpriced goods.Michael Douglas displays some hitherto unseen talent as the unbalanced D-FENS, as he casually totes gang weapons (complete with rubber bands on the grips) in his formal shirt and tie, does battle with store owners and comes up against fast food restaurants, homeless people, gangsters and Nazis. Robert Duval is equally brilliant as the desk jockey on his final day, determined to stop anyone else from being hurt, including the perp.There is, of course, a small amount of Hollywood sentimentality thrown in for good measure, however the dynamics of such a strong narrative make this completely forgivable and it's possible to overlook this as a flaw given the film's overall strengths.Praise surely has to go to Ebbe Roe Smith for writing one of the finest scripts ever to grace celluloid. Known for bit parts and cameos, who the hell knows who Ebbe really is? Look on IMDb to find out (if you're a geek like me) or release him into the ether if you don't care. The truth is, he's out there. The question is: Where's the next script?On the whole, Falling Down is a powerful and dramatic indictment of American culture, societal decadence, and the failing values of the West. It's not for everyone and will most certainly offend some, but if approached with an open mind, will provide plenty of fuel for thought.\",\n",

       " 'This is Kubrick\\'s farewell to Hollywood. I would have liked to be a fly on the wall. I don\\'t believe for a minute that it was a cordial parting of the ways. I mean, Kubrick never returned, never! With \"Paths of Glory\" Kubrick gave Kirk Douglas, not just his best part as an actor, but his best movie. By the time Douglas called Kubrick to \"take over\" \"Spartacus\" Douglas was already a huge star with too much saying in the matter. Look at it, it\\'s clear. \"Spartacus\" is more Douglas than Kubrick. Great fun to watch, yes, absolutely. A terrific script by black listed Dalton Trumbo. Some fight sequences unequalled in the history of film. Look at the fight between Douglas and Woody Strode and compare it to the ones in \"Troy\" or \"Gladiator\" for that matter. It is sad an embarrassing to realise how low we\\'ve fallen. Computer generated images or not. The cast is unbelievable but it\\'s clearly not Kubrick\\'s. The casting of his movies was part of his master plan. He would cast a Ryan O\\'Neil as Barry Lyndon for instance so he can blend perfectly with the magnificent tapestry, without adding any colours of his own. The same can be said of Keir Dullea, in 2001, a robotic non entity in a showdown with a voice. When he needed actors to be at the very pinnacle of his universe he went to Peter Sellers, Malcolm McDowell or James Mason. Even the casting of Tom Cruise made a lot of sense. He used the star and his wife to talk about the dreamlike powers of betrayal. In \"Spartacus\" Tony Curtis, plays Antoninus, a teacher of the classics. A campy idea never seen in a Kubrick film, before or since. To be fair, there are some spot on, brilliant pieces of casting. Charles Laughton is, as usual, superb. Peter Ustinov, terrific. Laurence Olivier manages to give a multifaceted portrait of weakness, fear and greed. Jean Simmons makes the reason to survive totally believable. But the cutesy love scene between her and a shiny muscular, coiffed Spartacus is truly terrible. As a final blow, the scene is enveloped in a sticky, corny music theme. Having said all that. Don\\'t you dare missing this epic. I\\'ts Kubrick\\'s goodbye to Hollywood and like everything else that the master said or do, he really meant it.',\n",

Not one dry eye in the place, it had a great tempo and didn't drag on or have any lulls in the story. We were both very pleased and are still engaging in conversations about the movie. It's my opinion to highly recommend to everyone go out and watch a great movie and a heartfelt movie that redefines love in this time and age we live in.

       " 'And it is a FILM.  It is no ordinary movie.  As a fan of Boogie Nights, I couldn\\'t wait for Magnolia.  Although its running time has made at least 20 people leave the auditorium, I have stayed for every single second.  The mood and stories and characters keep building and building and building, and when it finally comes down, I feel this immense sense of relief and wonder at how PT Anderson was able to come up with something so clever and intertwining and wonderous, and was able to pull it off.  This \"movie\" is not for everyone.  It is thinking-hat required.  I have also never been so excited to look up Bible verses before. The cast, as you have probably read, is superb.  I have never been so impressed.  This film has \"restored my faith in the filmmaking industry. To see these actors, crew, and the writer/director/genius at work is inspiring.\"  These people obviously love their craft, and one of my friends even said that the cast was \"touched by the hands of God...\" to which I whole-heartedly agree.  He also has said, \"\"This film not only teaches film makers how to make films, but it teaches movie watchers how to watch movies!\" to which I again whole-heartedly agree a thousand times over. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is absolutely outstanding as the only character who is \"normal.\"  His performance has made me smile and shake my fist in the air the three times I\\'ve seen Magnolia since it opened.  Tom Cruise is also spectacular.  As with every single last character, every line he utters is important to his character and what it means for the rest of the stories. Another outstanding performance/character is the part of police officer Jim Kurring, played by John C. Reilly.  His character is just so perfect and JUST SOOOOO PERFECT that it makes me smile every time he is on screen. Add to all of this one incredible soundtrack, and you have something that will go down in film history as legend and probably one of the most underappreciated, misunderstood, and definitely underseen films of all time.The soundtrack, oh, the soundtrack.  When listening to the songs, I can picture each exact moment as if I was watching the movie all over again, and it brings unexplainable feeling.  Aimee Mann\\'s songs, especially, are a perfect fit to a perfect story and mood. This film is not for everyone, but, if you want to see glorious filmmaking, acting, writing, and characters in action, I HIGHLY suggest you see Magnolia.',\n",
       " 'MORD39 RATING:   ***  out of ****This third APES film ingeniously manages to keep the franchise alive and produces what is arguably the second best film of the five originals.After the ultimate ending in BENEATH, who could have believed a new story was possible? Here the tables are turned from the original film with a remarkable twist: now three of our chimpanzee characters take off in Charlton Heston\\'s spaceship and wind up going BACK in time, to \"present Day\" Earth (1973 A.D.) Once it is learned that Zira (Kim Hunter in her best performance in the series) is pregnant with the child that could possibly turn our future into the PLANET OF THE APES, she and her husband Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) go from becoming honored celebrities to dangerous threats to humanity!It\\'s a brilliant idea, and now it is possible to start the series anew (chronologically, this movie comes first) and see whether or not Taylor\\'s nightmare from the first film can be prevented or will rear its ugly head for mankind. A little defending is in order here. Many people get hung up on the story\\'s notion that the chimpanzees can actually manage to fix Taylor\\'s ship from the first film and actually launch it. Well, I say that if you can suspend disbelief long enough to accept the idea of a society of talking apes, why can\\'t you accept that one of them (Dr. Milo) is a super-intelligent ape, sort of the \"Albert Einstein\" or \"Thomas Edison\" of his time? Besides, when folks get stuck on a point like that it becomes impossible for them to have a good time with a film. As Cornelius said in the movie: \"Dr. Milo was a genius well in advance of his time.\" He was able to fly the ship. Case Closed.Next case: the \"TV Movie\" look of the film. SO WHAT? People have become so accustomed to garbage like 1999\\'s THE MUMMY that unless all films are over-swamped with spectacular sets and numbing effects, they can\\'t enjoy them. Well, ESCAPE needs none of these to tell its simple story. It\\'s got something that sci-fi stories today have lost...\"heart\".',\n",
       " 'Martin Scorcese\\'s filmography as director is one of the most accomplished in modern film history.  While Cape Fear can\\'t even hold a candle next to \"Taxi Driver\", \"Raging Bull\" and \"Goodfellas\", it is still a fabulous remake of the 1962 noir classic and it keeps the viewer on the edge right through until the closing credits.Robert De Niro (in yet another brilliant teaming with Scorcese behind the camera) plays Max Cady, a psychopathic rapist who was sent to jail 14 years earlier for such crimes.  He leaves prison with vengeance.  Not for his victims or his prosecutor, but his defence councillor, Sam J. Bowden, played by Nick Nolte.  It seems Bowden did not defend Cady to the best of his ability.  Cady knows this and wants some payback.Cady\\'s initial return into Bowden\\'s life could not have come at a worse time.  Bowden has been forced to move his family to Florida after his infidelities threatened his marriage and career.  His wife is distrustful and worst of all, Bowden is on the verge of beginning another affair with a female workmate.  Added to that, his daughter is at the difficult age of 15.Almost by ozmosis, Cady understands these problems in the Bowden household and acts on them.  He begins terrorising Bowden and his whole family, taking it from one extreme to the next.What makes Cape Fear such a good film is the rapidly increasing sense of claustrophobia.  Scorcese makes a point of using almost only close up shots towards the end of the film.  It is a great touch that makes the viewer that much more scared as the film goes on.Along with that, Robert De Niro is superb as Cady.  Only occasionally does the role slip into parody.  Mostly he is expertly evil.Nick Nolte is good if not great, the same for Jessica Lange as Leigh Bowden. It seems as if they were void of any great lines in this film, which is unfortunate given their immense talent.  Julliette Lewis is absolutely brilliant as the young daughter, Danielle.  She slips effortlessly between curious sexual awakenings, rebellious teen and straight thinking woman.  Add in small roles for Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck (the leads of the 1962 version) and you have a great ensemble cast.So not the best Scorcese film ever, but some tight editing, great camerawork, a haunting theme and devilishly over-the-top  acting help make this a frighteningly fun movie to watch.  Strongly recommended.',\n",

Okay, some of the nature shots were okay, but that, well..., is nature for you. Honestly, why this bombardment of elite extravagance thrown into the face of the audience? Is it really necessary to show all that wealth obtained by force, slavery, extortion and corruption? Guess the message was clear, the elite making their fame and money over the backs of honest people, at least that seemed to be correct. And please, stop using all these Botox actors and actresses, just use real people, not the fake blown up Barbie dolls, sick and tired of that nonsense.

The past decade has seen Disney movies that were hit or miss. Some considered classics, some forgotten and some close to being classics but not there yet. Frozen changes this dynamic and creates a full fledged classic. Frozen IS not just a classic, it is THE Disney classic of the decade. It could position itself up there with the best of them. Disney returns to its roots with a vengeance. The best animated film of the past few years in my opinion. The story is heart melting, filled with the pure feeling and heart that has become a staple with the best Disney movies. It is a moving story that has family at its center. It is unpretentious in what it is trying to portray. The comedy hits right on the mark and the action packed adventure and thrilling journey make this a tale with a little bit of everything in the exact right amounts. It is a daring movie that is laugh out loud at the some moments and stunning and provoking at others. All achieved in balance. A true triumph in story telling that proves exactly what Disney does best and again proving that they are back to producing top quality films. This is an affecting human story, one that is significant. Startling and stunning, beautifully envisioned, emotionally powerful and relevant. Gorgeous visuals, stunning backdrops and intricacies like you have never seen before. The environments, the costumes, the character movements among other things make this film a gigantic step forward. The brilliant voice talents that breath life into this project need to be applauded and then some. The cast consisting of Kristen bell (Veronica Mars) and Idina Menzel(Wicked!)among many others bring winning charm, superior voice acting and magnificent vocals as well as heart to this tale. The sensational wit and humor, the arrays of different personalities, their emotions, their triumphs and falls make them some of the most interesting characters that people can relate to and some of the best i have seen in animation. The cast fully become the characters.The score and music is perfect. The score is grand. The sound, the texture, the harmony, the melody is in a class of its own. Above and beyond anything attempted by the animation studio in the past decade. I would place the songs up there with those of the 90's movies and 2000's Enchanted. A true all round musical triumph. Songs that will be stuck in your mind and you will be humming them and you won't even know it. And some you will be belting out at the top of your lungs because they are that good. Songs that progress the story and an essential part of it.So you have meticulously crafted breath taking animation, an affecting tale of the bond of family, romance, hilarious wit and humor courtesy of the characters especially sweet Olaf and heart stopping adventure. A true fairy tale that i would say could very well be The Little Mermaid or The Beauty and The Beast of this generation. FROZEN has that Disney MAGIC that has been missing for so long and it comes in full force here.\",\n",
       " 'Much more enjoyable than expected.The beginning of it is funny enough, but it is the ensuing few scenes which are riotously HILARIOUS and make it worth watching- I literally laughed until I cried.Toward the middle of the film, there is a wide gap where the laugh-out-loud moments are slowed and further and further apart, but still bring a smile or giggle here and there. The ending while good, is overshadowed by a preceding fight scene that is one for the books. It was really, really well done.The best part of the entire movie though, and what makes it stand out, is that if a person watching has more than two brain cells, the dialogue is spot-on close-to-perfect in mocking BOTH SIDES of the political divide. And here, is what I think people are missing: NEITHER side is depicted as being \\'better\\' than the other. Or worse. It has fun at the expense of everyone and it doesn\\'t do it in any overtly mean way, but in a way where we can nod and nod and nod and laugh ... at ourselves ... no matter who we are or where we stand.Lastly, a horror film - it is not.

This movie was a HUGE set back for Spiderman but sadly we live in a very tight lip controlled marvel press that have told us this is \"great movie\" because it came from another soulless product cake factory from marvel. This is the same Spiderman/Peter Parker from Civil War??? They severely dumbed him down for his solo movie and turned him into whiny clumsy idiot who screwed up constantly. Despite that Tom Holland is the best on screen Peter Parker and Spiderman to date. He deserved a MUCH better movie.I like Michael Keaton but his performance felt phoned in only to find that Keaton turned down this role twice before excepting it. Not his fault, am I\\'m the only one who thought the Vulture was lame? He was so hollow and them tying it up with the whole Damage Control thing felt forced and rushed.The high school stuff in this movie is awful. This movie was trying to so hard to be a John Hughes movie and it failed miserably. Homecoming was nothing like those movies. The teens in those movies were real, they smoked, drinked, swore, and acted like real teens. The supporting teen cast in Homecoming are nothing but terrible caricatures. Liz is a stock love interest with all the personality of a dry brick. She\\'s useless and Laura Harrier and Tom Holland have zero chemistry. I never bought that these two liked each other. All they\\'re very few scenes together are awkward. Flash was turned from a big jock bully bully into a annoying little doucebag who\\'s about as threatening as a newborn kitten. Ned is stock fat friend comic relief who\\'s not funny at all. Michelle was some wannabe hipster Daria type girl who hate everything. She served no purpose and the twist with character at the end was so forced and stupid. Aunt May\\'s transformation into an object of male gaze/desire (and nothing more). No mention of Uncle Ben which is ridiculous. I didn\\'t need to see him die again, but replacing Tony Stark as Uncle Ben\\'s place as a father figure is absolutely ludicrous!Dull washed out cinematography. This looked like a TV movie. Michael Giacchino\\'s uninspired score. Bad CGI on Spiderman, it looked WAY too cartoon. The action scenes were forgettable and had zero stakes. The Rubble scene had potential but it was poorly done, rushed, and ruined by water reflection with Tony\\'s voice over. It\\'s sucks because Holland acted his but off in that scene. All the Avengers/MCU references were forced and shoehorned it was eye rolling. The worst was the F, Marry, Kill game with Thor, Hulk, and Iron Man during the gym class. Really??? Speaking of gym class, those Captain America PSA segments were unfunny pointless filler. Jon Watts was a poor pick to direct this movie. His direction is bland and uncreative. He also doesn\\'t know how to direct action scenes. At least the Raimi movie had their own distinctive zany kooky style. Homecoming looks like every other MCU movie. This movie also had 6, yes SIX writers and it\\'s shows.The The forced diversity is so in your face. His best friends is Filipino, love interest is biracial, his bully is Guatemalan, weird girl is black, the Chinese and African kid on the decathlon team. No story-line progression. The movie is Peter wants to impress Mr. Stark to become an Avenger. That\\'s.... it. The terrible childish comedy. \"Hur duh penis parker\", \"I was watching porn\", \"your aunt is so hot\". This is the comedy were supposed to laugh at? What was with the cringe built by slaves comment in the Washington scene? That has no place in a spider-man movie.Bottom line! Spiderman: Homecoming is another over-hyped Summer blockbuster that will be forgotten about after a month which is exactly what happened. These MCU movies have no staying power. I already forgot Guardians 2 came out 3 months ago. By the way that movie also sucked too!',\n",
       " 'I saw \"Infinity Pool\" last night in the theatre. It is a very strange movie directed by Brandon Cronenberg, the son of David Cronenberg (\"Videodrome\", \"The Fly\", etc.) It is about a couple (Alexander Skarsgård and Cleopatra Coleman) who travel to a luxury resort in a repressive dictatorship. They meet another couple (Jalil Lespert and Mia Goth) who convince them to travel off the grounds of the resort, even though it is prohibited by the rules of the resort and country. Soon a tragedy occurs, and the couple is thrust into a fever dream of drugs, sex and violence. Mia Goth is excellent as the temptress who pushes Skarsgård\\'s character into doing things he would never think of doing. Skarsgård is wasted in this role and his character takes actions that defy common sense. And while some have praised Brandon Cronenberg\\'s direction - I found some of the strange angles and quirks he uses to be more annoying than ingenious. There is a surfeit of sex, violence and gore for those who enjoy that, but I cannot say that it really added anything to a convoluted plot that really makes no sense. Only recommended for Mia Goth\\'s standout performance - wait for cable or Netflix on this one. 5/10.',\n",
       " 'In an age of Xena-esque fantasy adventure films (al la the tepid Scorpion King) It is startling to go back and see just how good this movie still is. \"Conan\" is not for the faint of heart, and not just for gore - there are far more bloody movies out there - but for the uncompromising warrior-ethos John Milius infused into his vision.  There is nothing PC about this fantasy world.  When he is asked \"what is best in life?\" Conan paraphrases Genghis Khan: \"Crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of their women!\" We are not led to believe he is kidding. It is true that Arnold is no great actor, but it is also true he has always stuck with parts he can handle, and he does a fine job as Conan, but the real star here is the director.  John Milius is one of the greats, totally unappreciated in his time, and his sweeping scope and epic, gritty battle sequences add a dimension lacking from almost every other S&S film. There is a grim aura of doom pervading the movie that fits the original Howard stories to a T, and I think Robert E Howard would have really liked this movie.  James Earl Jones gives a killer performance as the evil Thulsa Doom, rivalling Darth Vader himself. A last point in this film\\'s favor is the score.  Basil Poledouris turned out his best score ever for this film: Brooding, powerful and operatic, it lends the film a grandeur Hercules could only dream of.  I must have seen this film 40 times and I still never get tired of it.',\n",
       " 'I was a fan of the \"V for Vendetta\" graphic novel, and Alan Moore disinheriting the film was a bit discouraging. But he\\'s always been a little crazy. The film version is everything I could have possibly hoped for - gripping, chilling, intense, exciting, heartbreaking. It gets Moore\\'s music if not his exact words; elements are slightly different, subplots removed. But the idea - as V himself would be so proud to say - remains the same.The plot is surprisingly complex and nuanced, and I don\\'t want to give anything more away than the previews already have. Suffice it to say that a masked anarchist (voiced by Hugo Weaving) must save a young woman (Natalie Portman) during his attempt to expose corruption in the government. Weaving is perfectly cast, using his formidable physicality and imposing voice to give gravitas to the insanity of the character. Portman has gone from child to teen star and is finally emerging as a talented, adult actress following her Oscar-nominated turn in \"Closer\". Here, she gives her best performance to date as the orphan Evey. John Hurt is characteristically impressive as the enigmatic government leader, and Stephen Rea gives a wonderful supporting turn as the police inspector charged with finding V - before it\\'s too late.The Wachowski Brothers\\' former protégé, James McTiegue, takes on the directing duties here and helms an enormously impressive first feature, using every trick in the book in a manner reminiscent of his mentors\\' breakout hit \"The Matrix\". Unlike \"The Matrix\", McTiegue allows the story to be more of a focus than the action, and as a result the film is a tense and emotional thriller, with outbursts of spectacularly filmed and choreographed action. Showing more maturity and restraint than the Wachowskis, McTiegue doesn\\'t show off, and his trickery isn\\'t self conscious. When slow-motion overtakes a late action sequence, it seems as natural as breathing. The late cinematographer Adrian Biddle (the film is dedicated to his memory) does an outstanding job, Oscar-nominated Dario Marianelli\\'s score is a fantastic accompaniment to the piece, and the visual effects are astonishing, terrifying, and deeply moving, especially in the climatic moments in Trafalgar Square.With solid acting, great action, and fantastic technical wizardry, it sounds just like another \"Matrix\"-style ripoff. But the biggest difference in \"V\" is that it is a story of real ideas - not a fantastic, science fiction creation, but a genuine examination of the human condition. The power of fear takes center stage here - the fear of war, of disease, of famine. Fear is a basic human nature, and has been exploited as a weapon - a method of control - for centuries. And for those who would use it, a masked man waits in the shadows to carry out your sentence. The verdict? Vengeance. \"V for Vendetta\" is a must-see.10/10',\n",
       " \"I saw this at a cast and crew screening in London last weekend: I'm not a huge Bond fan, but I do enjoy them on a purely popcorn level and this was definitely one of the best in recent memory. The tone is much edgier and nastier than the Brosnan movies, harking back more to Dr. No or For Your Eyes Only. The action sequences are brilliantly shot and edited for maximum impact and are some of the best out of any Bond movie. Martin Campbell, who also made 'Goldeneye', was an excellent choice and, for me, is one of the best Bond directors. What gives this the lead over recent Bonds is the more realistic feel: the exotic locales, fast cars, spectacular action, beautiful women and many other Bond hallmarks are all here but gone is the campy tone that marred, say, Die Another Day. Yes, the whole franchise is based on an entirely ridiculous and cartoonish notion but the more serious and harder-edged tone works really well here. In this context, Daniel Craig gives an excellent performance as Bond. I'll be the first to admit that I raised an eyebrow when I heard he was cast but he really makes it his own. It's hard to say whether he's better than any of the other Bonds: Connery and Brosnan felt right for the style of Bond movies they were in. Here, as suits the overall tone of the film, Bond is much more of a sadist, a cold-hearted killer with very little sense of empathy and Craig, with his piercing eyes, suits the role very well. He's charming and funny when required and totally convincing in the action sequences. The violence is less cartoon-like and flippant, too, with every punch, kick and shooting looking like they really hurt. Also, the story is just much more engaging than many a Bond film; the script's not going to win awards but it's consistently inventive and intriguing. Whilst the film has enough of it's fair share of action, the emphasis is equally on character and storyline and less on gadgets and sheer implausibility. When there isn't a huge action sequence happening, you don't miss it: the film's longest set-piece, the poker game at the Casino Royale, is as (or not more) gripping and entertaining than any of the chases and shoot-outs. The only minor gripes that I have are a slightly too long running time: the film drags a wee bit towards the end and, although it helps the tone of the film, we don't hear enough of the Bond theme tune! However, great directing and performances from everyone involved, along with Phil Meheux's excellent cinematography, Peter Lamont's as ever superb production design and all the other top-notch craft and technical departments make 'Casino Royale' a classy and very enjoyable night out at the movies.\",\n",
       " \"They had all the money, actors and special effects they needed so how did they manage to screw this one up? Obviously they thought exiting moments were more important than developing deeper characters and that's why this story that had great potential stayed so shallow. The dialog was always cheesy and none of the 'hero's' in this film really showed any real emotions nor did they give any of those speeches that give the audience goose bumps. Another thing that really bothered me was that so much was almost going wrong the whole time. Every second of the film had a 'close call' which made the film seem totally unrealistic. Examples are planes taking off just before the runway collapses or driving just fast enough to not get hit by an explosion. This can be very cool if it doesn't happen 100% of the time and I have never seen a movie abusing this way of creating excitement to this extent. So to sum up: If you feel like turning your brain off and watching special effects and big explosions with a very shallow storyline then this movie is for you. But if you feel like watching a movie with a bit of depth then go and see something else.\",\n",

       " 'Just caught this at the Toronto Film festival. It is undoubtedly one of the higher quality dramas in 2011. At its heart is a baseball-centric docu-drama, but even folks with zero baseball knowledge/interest can enjoy and be moved by this movie.Jonah Hill\\'s performance in the film is phenomenal, and this may be the break that that young actor has been joshing for. His portrayal Peter Brand, a Yale Economics major and full time computer nerd is beyond believable, you practically swear that you know him personally a few days after the movie.The role of Billy Beane, played by Brad Pitt, is an incredibly demanding one. While there are tons of dialog, hack arguments, display of physical rage, etc; it is the silent story telling, emotional turmoil, change-of-heart reflections, pupils-triggered catharsis, and so on that are the toughest to convey and requires a well-seasoned character actor. This is easily Brad at his widest acting range - and you see all of it in a little over two hours. To be totally honest, I have not been tracking Philip Seymour Hoffman\\'s acting career until this film. His portrayal of the ready-to-exit Oakland A\\'s coach Art Howe, caught between \"the for-sure old money\" and the \"crazy senseless new reality\", convinced me that they couldn\\'t have casted this part any better. Hoffman delivers on every single scene and you literally sweat his frustration along with him. This foil to Brad Pitt\\'s character is actually effective enough to save several heavy- drama exchange where Brad\\'s delivery falls slightly short of the mark.This is an \"onion\" movie, constructed purposely to be entertaining on many levels. It can be watched purely as an entertaining account of modern baseball history - how player statistics became one of the most important factors determining financial success in modern baseball. For more sentimental audience it tracks the journey of a man, forced to embrace change and disappointment as he fumble aimlessly through life etching out an unremarkable career first as a failing professional player, then small-time scout, and washed-out General Manager; only to finally wake up - and find himself becoming one of the greatest living innovator of the modern game.Finally, for the abstract-at-heart, and those who knows or cares little about the game of baseball (like yours truly), this is a tale of an industry under irreversible change; a documentary of the conflict between innovators who brave the slings-and-arrows to map out the new ways, and the old stalwarts who goes all out to protect their crumbling turf. At this historic moment in time, the message really hits a home-run! Other than baseball, we\\'ve recently witness similar changes and conflicts played out in public across the automobile, music distribution, movie distribution, book distribution, home computer, banking , and many other industries. Every unemployed in a vanishing industry can easily identify with the old Billy Beane, it is how Billy leverage his disappointment and experience, to turn his life around that we can all aspire to.A worthy note is the soundtrack for the movie, grass-root simple and heartfelt, it sent me looking for the album on itunes - only to realize that the movie has not been officially released yet.',\n",
       " \"After years of warning about global warning, Jack Hall is horrified to find all his predictions coming true much faster than he could have imagined. Hail stones the size of footballs decimate cities, typhoons destroy Los Angeles and New York becomes flooded. As the big freeze crosses the northern hemisphere, a small group of survivors try to fend off the cold as the world prepares for a dramatic change in the world order.This film may be a modern blockbuster but in almost everyway it is a 1970's disaster movie where an event happens after some build up and we then spend the rest of the film watching the survivors trying to, well, survive. In that regard the film carries all the usual problems that the genre carries but happily benefits from the fact that the effects are much better than 1970's movies could manage. For this reason the first hour is great \\x96 it has dramatic pace, is involving and looks fantastic even if we have seen it before in different variations (how many times has New York been destroyed now?). However after the sheer global terror is pretty much finished we suddenly become much more small scale and the film looses much of it's impact and it's pace. After the initial danger has passed the film uses illogical and silly plot devices to put the survivors at risk \\x96 a cold eye of a storm, blood infections, creeping ice and wolves are among the problems. While this is OK on a genre level it doesn't compare to the first hour and it gets a little dull and plodding at times.The clichés are all present and correct: the politicians, the upright scientists, the sacrifice, the daring rescues and so on. It's fair to say that if you are looking for more than a basic script then you will be looking in the wrong place here. All this film does is to provide spectacle and moments of dramatic action \\x96 if you want to think about it then you will only hurt your enjoyment of the action. The film tries to deliver an environmental message but in a way this film will not help the environmental movement because it is too exaggerated to be taken seriously (like the idea of Celtic and Man Utd reaching the Champions League final \\x96 during this season? Please!), however it does include several surprisingly barbed attacks on the US administration (could the VP look any more like Cheney?). Just a shame that the film message is delivered with all the subtlety that Segal showed when he did something similar in his environmental action film On Deadly Ground.The script doesn't really create characters either and it means we don't care that much about what happens to them in the final hour (countless millions are dead for goodness sake!). The dialogue in the first hour is nicely gruff and scientific and very genre but the second hour is more human and the lines aren't suited for that \\x96 not even in the hands of an impressive number of good actors. I like Quaid and he is a good lead here, he gets the good scientific stuff and only is lumbered with the rather silly notion of walking to New York from Washington. Gyllenhaal must have upset legions of cult fan boys by appearing in a big budget movie but he does OK with the role (despite looking too old to be in school). The rest of the cast are fairly mixed but, as with the genre, they are just filled even if some are good. Welsh is good even if he was cast for his similarity to Dick Cheney, Holm adds a small bit of dignity in his role as well as being supported by the very fine actor Lester in a minor role. Faces like Sanders, Mihok and a few others don't really matter as they are merely victims waiting for their turn to be used for dramatic effect.Overall the first hour of this film is good on a blockbuster level, but it blows it's wad too early (don't ya hate it when that happens?!) and is left with a second hour that is right out of the 1970's with all the weaknesses that that entails. Generally I enjoyed the film because I was just expecting a big noisy movie to pass a few hours \\x96 bad script, no characters and lots of clichés? Why would I be surprised by that? It's par for the course and you should not watch this if you know these aspects will annoy you. As it is, it's an average film but one that is noisy and spectacular enough to pass muster in the summer blockbuster stakes.\",\n",
       " 'WOW! What a movie. I can honestly say this is in my top ten movies of all time, how do Pixar continue to out do themselves at every movie release?The Incredibles is a fantastic story, wonderfully scripted and with the most stunning animation you have ever seen, it provides a perfectly rounded story with plenty of action, laughs and (almost) tears.Basically, this is a story of a man encountering a mid life crisis and leaping headlong into it without a care or a thought for his family, proving exceedingly selfish and failing to see the good in his life. Meanwhile the wife is left to try and look after the family. Really, that\\'s the story. Now, what Pixar have done is drop in the idea that the parents are Superheroes, banned from being Super many years previously by the Government and the people, trying to live a normal life. Add to the mix that some of their children have inherited their own powers and that the Super villains are planning a comeback, and you have this wonderful movie.I can\\'t begin to convey how wonderful the animation is, it\\'s perfect. I mean you\\'ll always be looking at it knowing it\\'s animation, but when the story takes you along you\\'ll suddenly realize you\\'re still watching animation. The subtle difference is that you forget, and there are parts (for instance when the father is cheering his son during the race) that you actually think it is real. The effects for water, fire (two of the hardest things to recreate in animation) and lava are wonderful to watch and caught me drawing a breath when I first saw them.The characters and acting are wonderful, and you will find yourself caring about them as real people. At some points I could feel a big swallow coming up and a wavering adams apple, obviously due to the food earlier, nothing to do with the movie.I often find that movies aren\\'t paced well, that they either have too long or too short an introduction to the characters, or the events that lead up to the pivotal point of the movie are unbalanced against the climax, all sorts of combinations. Not here, this move is perfect and well balanced, the story takes you along just when you are ready, and there were no points where I wished we could move on, or something could happen quicker. My only frustration were at the kids, and this was only because they were behaving exactly as real kids would.It was interesting to see the comparisons and links to other famous Superheroes through comic-lore. Definitely with nods to The Fantastic Four, Silver Surfer and huge nods to The Watchmen. My only concern is that there is so much similarity to The Watchmen that those who haven\\'t read the graphic novel will be saying \"That\\'s the Incredibles movie\" when Watchmen finally comes to fruition.The short film showing before this was wonderful in itself, and had the audience laughing out loud loads. Excellent, and once again, outdoes every short that they\\'ve produced before. Boundin\\' was beautifully animated and wonderfully told. Guaranteed to bring a huge big smile to your face.All in all I think this movie is perfect and truly incredible.',\n",
       " \"This film really needed a PLOT. And characters, some people to root for. Instead, the poor pacing, lack of tension and suspense made for a kind of dull film experience. Yes, Art is a crazy, vicious clown killer. If that's all you want, then you'll see it here as he wounds, kills and dismembers people. The problem is, he will injure someone--a woman's ankle is almost torn out--and the next scene, she's running. People have their heads bashed in...and later, are able to get up and function. It really doesn't make a lot of sense and since Art seems to pop up in more places than possible, he's never really a surprise--he's overused. Clearly the director knew the story was thin, so every few minutes, Art pops up to attack someone. It really is disappointing since the short films showed some potential but when a whole film is given to Art, he's boring and predictable. I'm sure there will be another one--I hope the screenplay is given as much attention as the gore effects.\",\n",
       " \"2009's X-men Origins: Wolverine was received negatively by both critics and the majority of the fans of the character. Now the character has a chance to redeem himself with this year's the Wolverine and for the most part he does. This film has really tried to please the fans as it was loosely based on the beloved Japan story line from the comics and it is clear that the film has tried to fix the problems that were complained about in the previous solo Wolverine film. Despite taking place after the events of X-men: The Last Stand this film attempts to distance itself from the rest of the X-men characters and story and focuses solely on the Wolverine character and as a result this film feels very different to all previous X-men films. This allows for the best portrayal of Wolverine's character that we have seen so far and Hugh Jackman also delivers his best performance of the character to date. I really enjoyed the pacing of the film as well because although it was a face paced action film it wasn't afraid to slow things down and develop the characters and the relationships between them. However it never slows down for too long before it picks up the pace with another action scene. The action in this film is also very well done because every sequence is creative and has a purpose so it never feels like the mindless action we've come to expect in big budget summer films. Humour is also used effectively in this film as the writers take advantage of Wolverine's IDGAF attitude. However the film isn't perfect as there is one other mutant character that occasionally seems slightly out of place and some people might find her character a bit too over the top. Also from time to time it does feel like they are playing it too safe to insure that they don't make any of the same mistakes as the last Wolverine film. Overall The Wolverine, although not perfect, is a fun superhero film that gets a lot of things right about what makes the Wolverine character so popular.\",\n",
       " 'I watched this Beatles documentary for the first time when it was released for the second time in the Spanish theaters in 1980.I enjoyed it very much in spite of being 10 years old, because a friend of mine had the \"Let it be\" tape and we used to listen to it very often and we both knew all the songs pretty well. We had a splendid time.Now I have a copy in VHS of the film and I use to watch it from time to time. I know it´s mostly a documentary about The Beatles break-up which is kind of sad, but it would be unfair to say the film is not most enjoyable and besides the rehearsals and the arguments, it ends with the very last Beatles concert, (the famous rooftop concert).The Beatles were four guys who spent some six years together 24 hours a day, \"eight days a week\" as they would say, working very hard, dealing with all kind of stressing events and it´s logical they split up in the end. Fame is very expensive. George Harrison explains it very well in the last chapter of The Beatles Anthology: \"The fans gave the money and the screams, and The Beatles kind of gave their nervous systems...\". And I agree with him. It had to be hell!.None of the four Beatles was to blame for their break-up, that´s something that just had to happen.If you ever have the chance of watching this film, just do it. It´s a must for all the Beatles fans and all the music lovers.I hope this gem is released in DVD with lots of extras in the near future!!. Please, release it!!.Long live the Beatles!.',\n",
       " 'Up until now, I was convinced that from the 4th book onwards, Harry Potter-books had become too complex to make into film: Goblet of Fire was a sore disappointment. Order of the Phoenix left many Potterheads wanting more, even if it wasn\\'t a bad film per se (personally I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though I felt they left out too much). Half-blood Prince -while visually stunning- did not capture the brilliance of the book. With \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\", I think the makers have finally succeeded in crafting a movie that was both fun to watch for casual viewers while also catering to the needs of the hard-core fans who know the books by heart. The decision to split the movie into two parts may be judged as a financial one by some, but I\\'m convinced it was the only possible way to make this work. The movie was cut off at the perfect time as well, having the viewers yearn for more without being too abrupt.I don\\'t want to give away anything, so I\\'ll just say this: Hats of to you, David Yates.

This is just mindless entertainment for kids with a very basic message.I also thought the acting extremely poor and I don't think there was a single good performance in it.

Some warnings.  There is a brief scene where some skinning dipping boys are chasing the girls who have stolen their clothes.  It begins with a very quick shot of an older boy's penis as he flips into a pond (I didn't see at first, but my daughters did after repeated viewings and use of the pause button), followed by a discussion of male erections by the four girls.  The scene is so well written and handled that parents could actually use it to break the ice in the discussion of sex with their children.  I did.  The girls then proceed to steal the boy's clothes and are chased on their bicycles by the four boys who are seen nude from the rear.  This scene is played so innocently and cute that a parent need not worry about it, though I have noticed my girls rewinding that scene.  A parent should not worry about their children viewing this film, however, the parent should watch it with their children.\",\n",

Mine is that the movie depicted perfectly the status of women just right after the end of 2WW and the challenges they had to face in everyday life. Something that feels so far way from now, but still not so far away considering all the injustices women nowadays have to live with in every aspect of their life.Well, the protagonist tries really hard for find a balance dealing with a violent husband, multiple jobs, 3 children and an annoying father in law, but she also surrounds herself with good friends and women with strong personalities.The pace of the film Is entertaining, great comedy moments, costumes very on point, and the use of the camera very intelligent (at one point, I even recognize an angle that reminded of a famous painting of the Mantegna , the Cristo Morto)\\nBeautiful selection of music as well.But honestly what really made the film great and emotional, is the finale.

       " \"The first time I saw this movie I had difficulty in understanding a lot of the dialogue not just because of the weird accent, but because the actors spoke so damn fast.  But despite this I became literally addicted to it. To begin with my wife got pretty annoyed because any other movie we rented would be ejected after about 20 minutes of viewing and in would go LS&2SB. Now she is hooked as well.I have lost count of the number of times I have seen LS&2SB and still cannot put my finger on why I find this movie so good to watch.  I suppose the most obvious feature of this movie is that it is beautifully balanced between being serious and humorous at the same time.  The characters are two-dimensional.  The villains are menacing, and yet they are made to look like idiots, and the good guys think they are so smart yet keep getting the rug pulled from under them.  They are all projected as 'cool' yet the situation is always out of their control.  Maybe it could be called a satire on true life.The style of this movie is unique, full stop.  I cannot think of any movie that can be compared to LS&2SB.  Quite a few people say that the style is a mix of 'Pulp Fiction', 'Goodfellas', 'Trainspotting' and 'Reservoir Dogs', but I think that you would make that kind of description only if you are really desperate to match LS&2SB to something.The best description I can think of is 'MTV does a crime comedy', and I honestly don't think there is anything wrong with that.  Like music videos, it is all non-stop movement and sound.  Something is always happening but unlike music videos, not without reason.The humor is incredibly sharp yet 'as a matter of fact'.  No one is really trying to be extraordinarily funny, but again it is the balance between being menacingly serious and funny that the humor really flies at you. I think that it is for this reason that a few people are really disappointed with LS&2SB.  If you are expecting a 'belly laugh Leslie Nielson, Jim Carrey, Steve Martin, typecasted' type all out comedy, or a serious 'Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, DeNiro typecasted crime thriller, you will find this movie a big let down.My favorite characters are Rory Breaker (Vas Blackwood) and Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) mainly because their two dimensional over-the-top characters are the most obvious.  Big Chris takes his son with him debt collecting, and while he beats up someone who owes chastises him for swearing in front of his son and Rory Breaker is the most idiotic drug-lord you could come up with.I haven't even mentioned the excellent and unique camerawork, speaker blowing soundtrack, beautifully threaded plot, perfect ending and the grittiest visuals I've seen.  You wont see any reflective glass laden sky scrapers here, or 'over head city shots', or incredible special effects. This movie has actors I have never heard of, dialogues that you have to rewind and replay to understand, buildings that look as though they have been condemned for demolition, cars that wouldn't even be seen in our scrap yards, has probably been made with a budget that most movies in Hollywood use for make-up alone, has no love scenes, or romance or complex relationships, no Oscar-worthy performances, and yet is perfect entertainment.Where our movies normally rely on budgets, this movie works on human talent alone.If any movie deserves a 10 out of 10, then this is it.'And there's one more thing...............it's been emotional'\",\n",
       " \"This film is a rather special genre-mix of classic Western themes and gory, insane B-movie horror elements. Films like the quite watchable The Burrowers (2008) and Dead Birds (2004) have mixed those ingredients before with some success, but while those two were undoubtedly B-movies, Bone Tomahawk never feels like your typical straight to VOD genre film.What really stands out right from the start is the writing: the precise dialog and never less than interesting characters are what really makes this film a winner in my book. The premise might not be very original - it's Western to the bone (pun intended) and very much in the tradition of great classics like The Searchers - but despite its dark themes, there is so much understated humour in Bone Tomahawk that I felt at times reminded of some of the characters in Jim Jarmusch's films. And Richard Jenkins' character, back-up deputy Chicory, is down-right hilarious. The acclaimed (and Oscar-nominated) actor clearly has a blast with his part, and the same can absolutely be said for the rest of the cast. This is a film that is willing to spend a very considerable part of its running time just building atmosphere and exploring the different characters, and the action/horror moments are actually few and far between. According to some recent interviews with the producers, the excellently written characters are also what drew A-list actors Kurt Russell and Patrick Wilson to the film, despite its micro-budget, and if Russell hadn't been so committed to playing the part of Sheriff Franklin Hunt, the film wouldn't have been made.In spite of its tiny budget, this is a quality film that really should have had a wide theatrical release; everything from the A-list cast to the excellent cinematography, sound and production design practically scream for the big screen. A word to the wise, though; after some initial mayhem, the film moves along at a very considerate pace (and at over two hours it's a rather long film), so for those who seek entertainment heavy on action with non-stop shoot-outs, gory thrills and scares, look elsewhere: this is probably not the film for you (and perhaps also not the film that was promised in the trailers). But if you like old-school Westerns with great characters (played by great character actors), great atmosphere and deadpan humour, and you ALSO don't mind (very!) gory thrills, scares and some bloody shoot-outs along the way, I believe you will enjoy this film very much.

The storyline follows a young lady raised by her grandmother in the country who heads off to fashion school in London. She struggles to adjust to the city and her classmates and decides to get a room of her own and away from people. She starts having visions and dreams once she moves about a young, naive woman like herself who tries to make it in London also and was badly taken advantage of. This movie is directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead) and stars Thomasin McKenzie (Old), Anya Taylor-Joy (Queen's Gambit), Matt Smith (The Crown) and Terence Stamp (Superman). This movie had so much potential with a great premise and set-up, fantastic flashback sequences, a great cast and remarkable use of lighting, color and cinematography. The acting is also pretty good, though I'd say McKenzie's performance was a bit uneven, especially towards the end of the movie. This film after a good set-up falls apart and spins out of control to a messy and unorganized conclusion that gets painful to watch at times. The horror elements also don't align well with the premise and could have been executed so much better...I didn't love the use of CGI, especially when you discover the true plot and think back on where and when the horror elements took place. This is a frustrating film that had a lot going for it but felt like it didn't know where to go the last half of the movie. I'd score this a 3.5-4/10 and recommend skipping it.\",\n",

And Mikkelsen wasn't the only actor allowed to mumble.I also felt that in the direction the actors' choices could have been a lot bolder.

       " 'I have seen Moulin Rouge at least 25 times.  I think it is the most extraordinary movie of my generation and breaks every limit set by the industry.  I have heard all the traditional complaints...people didn\\'t like the music, the editing was too swift, or it wasn\\'t \"their taste\".  Moulin Rouge took a risk.  A risk films like A Beautiful Mind and Shakespeare in Love don\\'t.  It risked by being controversial.  To make a likeable movie isn\\'t hard, follow the Hollywood mold and stick in a few attractive actors, some bland dialogue and viola you have a film.  Moulin Rouge was made knowing that not everyone would like it, but knowing everyone would at least appreciate it for its artistic ingenuity.  Visually it is superb, an indulgent feast for the eyes with every breathtaking, artistic scene. Everything about it is over the top, every scene more stunning than the next, and as it continues your heart becomes more and more intertwined in the love story.  The editing in the Roxanne scene rushes through your body and is the most incredible of any movie in history.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor are the most passionate on-screen couple; entirely convincing as their voices meld them together into one.  Never has a movie done what Moulin Rouge did.  It realized that the world of film is only being represented in one small way, whereas Moulin Rouge uses a camera and screen to make something bigger and more extraordinary than has ever been made before.  It pushes against the confines of convention and leaves you breathless.',\n",

       " '\"Speed\" was a runaway success in 1994.  It was a block-buster in every sense of the word and critically speaking, it is an excellent motion picture.  The film deals with an LAPD swat officer (Keanu Reeves) who is playing a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with crazed ex-cop Dennis Hopper.  After Reeves stops Hopper from blowing up a high-rise building, the next obstacle is a city bus.  Hopper has rigged the bus to explode if the \"speed\" ever drops below 50 miles per hour.  Sandra Bullock, in her star-making role, plays an unlucky passenger who becomes the center of attention when she is forced to be the driver when the original navigator is accidently shot.  The great thing about \"Speed\" is the fact that it never tries to be more than it is. It goes for non-stop action, thrills, chills, and spills.  However, Dennis Hopper\\'s character is somewhat complex and his performance probably should have garnered him an Oscar nomination.  A great film in spite of the fact it is from the action genre.  5 stars out of 5.',\n",
       " 'The first time I watched this, I really didn\\'t know what to make of it; it was so different from any other film I had ever seen. It seemed as if it was filmed with virtually no budget, the sets and atmosphere were completely dingy, the setting and much of the language was foreign to me, and it felt like a kind of homemade independent film. However, upon a second viewing, I see it for the richly-textured masterpiece that it is, and for the awesome attention to detail that must have gone into it which I had taken for granted the first time.There have been other films with similar subject matter in alternate settings of cultured men reduced to a kind of forgotten primitivity, but I think the thing that sets this movie apart is the fact that director Ted Kotcheff remains completely neutral toward all of the characters - both the cultured schoolteacher as well as the locals. By the end of the film, no character remains unscathed, and yet no character is completely without sympathy, either. It must be quite difficult for a director to remain impartial, especially when most stories require audience sympathy for a protagonist versus an antagonist for story momentum. This impartiality establishes an incredible realism in the film which is difficult to shake off. Here, as in life, things just happen to the main character organically - whether there is any rhyme, reason, or moral to any of it is the complete burden of the audience to figure out.Another key aspect to the film is its universality. Most people would like to believe that in the modern world, and especially a modern country such as Australia or the U.S, that such ugly colloquial primitivity has been largely purged from polite society, but they would be quite wrong. I can equate some of my own personal experiences with those of the main character in this film, and so felt an uncomfortable recognition as I was watching this. Moroever, virtually every scene in the film I could envision actually occurring - something I cannot say about any other I can think of. Sam Peckinpah\\'s filmic explorations of perverse masculinity, some of Samuel Fuller\\'s work, and \"Deliverance\" are the only movies that achieve something close to the kind of effect this movie has, and even Peckinpah felt the need to resort to flashy cinematic stylistics to get his points across.This movie has not aged one bit, and probably never will. It is a tragedy that it has all but disappeared even in its own country of Australia. Director Kotcheff displayed an amazing early talent; it is too bad that his career never reached another peak like this - even in \"First Blood\" and \"Uncommon Valor\" - two of his other films with similar themes. And that the same man ended up directing \"Weekend at Bernie\\'s\" and episodes of \"Zalman King\\'s Red Shoe Diaries\"!!! The world is a crazy place, and one need only watch this film to realize this fact.',\n",

There is enough silliness, adventure, and romance to allow boys and girls of almost all ages to love this show. There were some funny lines in the show that kids would not understand, but adults would enjoy. I heard a gentleman laughing throughout the whole show. I am not around teenagers, so I am not sure how a teenager would respond to this show. The storyline was different but predictable. That should not discourage anyone from going to this show.

       " \"A lot of posts focus on the 'coming of age' aspect of this movie, but the very overlooked part is the role it played in helping to alleviate many of the stereotypes a very Asian phobic America was after WWII, Korea and Vietnam.They make a point of showing Miyagi in a US Army Uniform--and a War Hero-- and makes references to detention camps Miyagi's family was sent to (a horribly dark period in American history)...where Miyagi's wife was being sent (pregnant) and where she and his unborn child (son) ultimately die during childbirth. There are also a few scenes in which ethnic slurs are used by rednecks toward Miyagi.Taking this into light, and taking the fact that Daniel has no father that we know of in this movie, the name Daniel-san (sounds like Daniel-SON) helps demonstrate a father son bond that is overlooked. Much of the conversation between Daniel and Miyagi is about Miyagi's great father in Okinawa, because Miyagi has acquired all this knowledge and wants to share it. Daniel substitutes for the son Miyagi never had and Miyagi substitutes for the father Daniel doesn't have.\",\n",

I am not set on good guy vs bad guy and good guy winning. I like thought provoking films; i enjoy them much more than the soul sucking films that are manufactured on a daily basis. So i was intrigued by this one. The trailer was dark and seemed full of suspense. The critics had made bold comparisons with Stanley Kubrick, which in itself is a massive compliment. And as someone who lives in Scotland it had a little sentiment to it. But for me it was dull. Every time i thought it was going to pick up the pace, it decelerated. It was so slow it may as well have been going backwards. There are far too many scenes that are prolonged. I am fully aware of its intention to focus on aesthetically driven scenes. But 5/6 seconds is enough to appreciate it, not 10/15 seconds. At some points i thought the reel had maybe stuck and was expecting a CineWorld employee to come pacing round the corner to explain that there was something wrong. It just pauses at points that don\\'t need that much attention. I am also aware of the symbolic nature the film carries. It is clearly a film you need to look further to understand it in more depth. That is fine; i welcome that, but the problem is that it does this without conviction. I don\\'t need to see the masses of drunkards who swarm Sauchiehall Street 20 times. What is the purpose? To let us know that we, as people, blindly walk through life intoxicated not appreciating the finer things in life? That Under the skin we are empty? I assume that is a candidate for its meaning.Scarlett Johansson doesn\\'t have a lot to do in this film; basically make small talk and get naked, all the while with a plain face. And considering how ridiculous the Scottish actors are made to look, maybe she is due some credit for maintaining that straight face. There are a few things that bug me however; like she can walk down your average staircase, but panics with a spiral staircase. There is a definite point to this film, but with the layout, with there being no real culmination, no real explanation, it leaves you feeling you have been robbed of a film that could have been more. Could have told a better story. And for any Americans who watch, not all Scottish people talk like that, or wear horrible purple shirts, unnecessarily tucking them into our over elevated jeans. We don\\'t all support Hibs and when a van is parked not all of us will gang up and try to break into the van. So feel free to visit. It is a nice place after all. Although the film had some stunning scenes and promotes Scotland visually, it doesn\\'t exactly put the people in a great light. I wanted to enjoy this film, but i couldn\\'t. I wanted to agree with comparisons with Kubrick, but i certainly won\\'t. You can throw arguments of it was beautifully crafted or had symbolic serenity, but at the end of the day it is slow, uneventful and lacked culmination.',\n",

There is not a single person of color in this film who plays a negative character. The rednecks are what this film is really making fun of.

Mel Brooks doesn't always hit the mark with his comedy, but this film was by far his best effort.Cleavon Little and Harvey Korman give the best performances in my opinion.

I loved to see how they magnified the stereotypes about the French, the English, The Germans,... and made fun about the Catholic church. Some people pointed out that it was clear that the makers really don't know anything about the countries they were making jokes about. Possible, but it didn't bother me once. It's a comedy, not a traveler's guide!This is how the story goes: A teenager is dumped by his girlfriend on the day of their graduation.

But of course they don't just end up in Berlin. They start their trip in London, going to Paris, Amsterdam and Bratislava before getting to Berlin...The movie's script or the plot were probably the least of the director's concerns. It's clear that they just wanted to go to Europe, have some fun and film one hilarious situation after the other. I've got the feeling that most of the European viewers didn't mind being the subject of the movie.

       " \"Here's a surprise: The Gift is a mature thriller that's more complex and classy than the trailers suggest. I don't know what caused the marketing department to make the film look like such a second-rate, cheap, predictable thriller that somehow had gotten ahold of talented actors, but now we know the truth. As Joel Edgerton's directorial debut, it's impressive, considering the sense of craft going on behind the camera. The cinematography is gorgeous and the pacing is that of a slow burn, but it's never dull. The premise is also deceptively simple, turning more intricate and involving as the film progresses.Edgerton, who also wrote the screenplay, refuses to adhere to genre conventions, constantly subverting audience's expectations on how the story plays out. Red herrings, plot twists, shifting perspectives, and moral ambiguity ensue, but they never feel cheap. Like the best thrillers, The Gift evolves naturally and realistically. Edgerton and Rebecca Hall are great, but it is Jason Bateman who impresses. As a natural comedian actor, he plays one of his rare, serious roles to terrific effect. But I digress. You should go into this film with a clean slate, but know that it is a rare, intelligent thriller that doesn't cheat or spoonfeed its audience.

It is perhaps pure nostalgia, mixing pathos and humor, sadness and craziness, hope and reflection in quiet little bursts of excitement. After cruising with Milner all night, teenage Carol hates to say goodbye but does, waving from her porch with the light on; Toad survives one bad accident after another, but his real moment is in hearing praise from his date (fantastic, husky-voiced Candy Clark, dolled up like a speeding Sandra Dee) just before she says good night; after chasing his dream date all night, Kurt (Richard Dreyfuss, green and anxious, and appealingly bemused) finally gets to talk to the stunning blonde wonder on the telephone, where she whispers a wrenching goodbye.

       " 'Starting in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock directed a remarkable sequence of films in a row, each of them a classic; Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). Never has a director made four such genuinely great movies in such a short space of time, either before or since.The pick of this high standard bunch is undoubtedly Vertigo. From the opening titles, with their circling spiral imagery, to the dramatic final scene this is a movie that takes you to a different time and place. Specifically, to a San Francisco of the past; full of deserted parks, discrete rooming houses, oddly menacing art galleries and florists where the customers enter and exit through the back door. Through this landscape wanders Jimmy Stewart, towering in the lead roll as a former detective recently retired after a bungled arrest leaves him with chronic vertigo. Plot machinations lead him to the alluring Kim Novak (one of Hitchcock\\'s famous \"blondes\"), the young wife of a friend who has started behaving rather oddly.\"To reveal more,\" as Leonard Maltin wrote, \"would be unthinkable.\"While the performances of Novak and Stewart are memorable, the movie is really set apart by the intelligent script and the stylistic touches provided by the director. Hitchcock is in his very best form creating hypnotic scenes and a general sense of unease and dread in even the most banal of situations. He is aided in this by the wonderful score of Bernard Herrman. A particular favourite of mine is the extended (largely silent) segment where Stewart follows Novak for the first time. Nothing much happens, but the atmosphere of these scenes is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat!One of the all-time greats. They definitely don\\'t make them like this anymore.',\n",
       " \"I saw this film again yesterday for what must now be the tenth or so time and it's a film that makes me stop whatever I'm doing and immerse myself in the unfolding story. Never mind the fact that I am by now familiar with the premise, which incidentally far exceeds similar ones of the genre released at this time - Vice Versa and 18 Again (the latter being truly dire).I think this is one of Hanks' finest hours and see it as the pinnacle of his early pre-90's career. His later performance in Philadelphia would eclipse this role, although this was obviously more serious in its message.It takes real talent to act the young boy in the body of a thirty something and Hanks' copes admirably, from the comical leaping around the bedroom when he is trying to put on the jeans of the child on discovering his transformation to the child-like reaction displayed on Perkins' advances toward him. He captures the essence of youthful innocence both in the company of his younger peers and older 'work' colleagues.Elizabeth Perkins complements the performance of Hanks' and it seems a shame that on searching the database that her career perhaps hasn't mirrored the success of Hanks' since making 'Big'.I don't know why, but I always shed a tear at the end of the film. Perhaps it is the longing in all of us to want to return to the days of our youth and that we cannot turn back the clock as one can in the imaginary world of film.As I grow older, and watch my children grow-up it makes me realise that time is a precious commodity and that life is a gift that should be cherished and nurtured carefully.

       " \"Like most who saw this film, I would guess, I was exposed to it in college, and I have to admit much of it went past me at the time. I liked the stark and unusual visuals, and I liked most of the story, but I'd be lying if I said I understood everything that was going on. Not that 'Rumble Fish' is particularly deep, just that in college I wasn't. Viewing the movie with a more mature mind now, I appreciated it much more than I did when I was nineteen.Based on the S.E. Hinton novel (Coppola also translated 'The Outsiders', which remains remarkable even today for its amazing cast), 'Rumble Fish' follows the story of one Rusty James (Matt Dillon, in full bad-boy mode) stuck in the middle of nowhere (Tulsa, actually), dissatisfied with his life but not really bright enough to know why. His older brother, the Motorcycle Boy (Mickey Rourke, long before he became a punchline), wheels back into town from a long sojourn, and what there is of a plot begins.Much of this movie is atmosphere, which normally irritates me but for some reason works incredibly well here. The black and white film is actually part of the story, which is in itself unusual, but it complements the storytelling and actually adds depth to the film. Though we see eighties-era cars, some of the movie has an almost fifties-feel to it, and like Rusty James, the viewer is never sure when, or where, he is. The bleak setting of Tulsa only reinforces the sense of both isolation and containment, which is the central theme of the film. Dillon is very strong here. His seething anger can never really find a way to express itself adequately, and Dillon spends the whole film out of sorts in his own skin, giving a remarkable performance. Diane Lane, whom I suspect was hired for her stunningly good looks, has a smaller role but is very effective as the put-upon Patty. Most of the rest of the young cast \\x96 unknowns or relatives or friends of the director at that point in time (Nicolas Cage, Chris Penn, Lawrence Fishburne, Tom Waits, even a very-young Sophia Coppola) are all very, very good. Waits and Fishburne have tiny roles but large presences on screen, and they stick in the viewer's mind even when they aren't there. Dennis Hopper is unusually relaxed and natural as Rusty James' dad (called only Father); sometimes Hopper can get gimmicky or artificial with his acting, but here he is subtle and wholly effective as a drunken shell of a man. But the standout performance is really Mickey Rourke, reminding us that before he pissed his career away on crappy low-budget films with the likes of Don Johnson, he was actually a decent actor. Rourke imbues the Motorcycle Boy with a wholly different restlessness than Dillon's Rusty, and makes him both compelling and sympathetic. Honestly it helps that Rourke has some of the best lines in the film, most notably one of my favorite quotes from any film: 'You want to lead people, you have to have some place to take 'em.' Motorcycle Boy is also something of a transitional hero, knowing he is damned to live, and die, in this hellish world but making sure the path to redemption (and escape) is secured for his follower (he even says of Rusty, 'His only vice is loyalty.')'Rumble Fish' is mostly an artsy character piece, the type of film that normally does not appeal to me, but Coppola displays such skill with the material and is so willing to subvert the very conventions of his film so that they further serve the characters and their development that the movie works, and works very well. Though the color tricks betray themselves rather badly on DVD (we were never meant to see this movie this clearly), the film still carries an enormous punch on the small screen as it did on the large. A bleak film that nonetheless carries within a message of hope, that one can escape the cages of one's surroundings if one tries hard enough.\",\n",

I think the Farrelly Brothers wanted to recapture the success of \"There\\'s Something About Mary\" -- but they\\'ve flopped hard.The universe of \"Mary\" was completely wacky and any naughty parts just fit into that universe. This one feels like there were too many screenwriters tinkering with it. (5 are listed). Someone wrote a mainstream romantic comedy script -- then someone else (The Brothers, I\\'m guessing) came along and just stuck in gross shocking bits.It\\'s very uneven.

       " 'What Spielberg, Cruise, and Koepp accomplish here in the first two acts is nothing short of revolutionary. They\\'ve made a big-budget summer blockbuster about massive destruction and action that manages to studiously avoid every cliché and expectation of such films. It stays resolutely on the characters\\' points of view, showing us almost nothing they don\\'t see, even to the point of coming tantalizingly close to a raging battle, then avoiding showing it. It keeps its focus on character instead of spectacle. The \"hero\" of the piece remains decidedly unheroic, wanting only to escape, and trying to talk others out of fighting back. The purpose of every piece of action is to frighten and disturb rather than thrill, making ingenious use of familiar 9/11 imagery. At the end of the second act, it is hands-down the best alien invasion film ever made, and perhaps one of the best sci-films of all time.Then something strange happens. The filmmakers lose their nerve, and remember that this is an extremely expensive summer film financed by two studios. Or perhaps it was the fact that it stars Tom Cruise, who up to this point has spent almost two hours doing nothing but run for his life. Suddenly, and tragically, the film changes, violating not only its carefully established tone, but its own internal logic. Suddenly, Cruise begins to act like a hero, and summer action clichés force their way into the story like a worm into an apple. The transition is jarring, and it creates a serious disconnect from the story.While it\\'s true that Wells\\' original ending creates a problem for a movie, here they try to remain faithful to it, while still shoehorning moments of triumph into the conclusion. Unfortunately, these moments come off as alternately false, unbelievable, and meaningless, since it isn\\'t mankind that defeats the invaders in the end.Is it recommendable? Well, I suppose that depends on what kind of viewer you are. If you feel that 75% brilliant material overshadows the 25% that falls apart, then you\\'ll enjoy it. If, however, you\\'re the kind of viewer who feels that the final impression a movie makes is its ultimate stamp on your memory, you may be in for a crushing disappointment. On the other hand, if you\\'re the kind of viewer who just likes the cliché of the boom-boom summer action spectacle, you\\'re likely to be bored and frustrated with the first two acts, and only engage in the end. It is confused about what audience it\\'s trying to reach, and consequently, isn\\'t likely to satisfy any of them.',\n",
       " \"Director Derek Cianfrance may wish to stop wasting his talent on TV and make films his full time occupation. Cinema could use him. His 'Blue Valentine' studies the breakdown of a marriage through beautiful and heartbreaking juxtaposed scenes of past joy and optimism with present scenes of misery and depression. Flitting back and forth in the marriage, it asks: Is romantic love the ultimate form of masochism?Fine young actors Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams play Dean and Cindy, who unite through a dogged courtship. Dean is easy-going, happy-go-lucky and content in his removal and packing company. He is chary of formal education, but has a philosopher's outlook. Cindy is sexually over-active and, although occasionally frolicsome, is more mature than Dean. About five years on, romance becomes repulsion, and their marriage becomes one of inconvenience. Make no mistake, this is uncomfortable viewing – not the sex, which serves the story quite well – but the paranoia, pettiness and pugnacity in the couple's interaction. They reach their nadir when he practically begs for affection, and she pleads with him to be more ambitious.No two actors have complemented each other this well for some time. In an age where vapid acting is vogue, Gosling is a novelty. He is very charming, yet he has a mournful countenance, and possesses a James Dean-like vulnerability. He'd be my poster-on-the-wall if I were 13. I can't get that entrancing scene where Dean serenades Cindy out of my head. Dean's philosophical outpourings may be interpreted by some as drivel, but more sensitive viewers will detect the shattering honesty. A memorable maxim: 'Girls spend their whole life looking for Prince Charming and then marry the guy who's got a good job and is gunna stick around.'We go to the movies – many of us – to escape real life. Comfortable as voyeurs, we let our favourite stars distract us and we forget our worries. But 'Blue Valentine' shows a truth no cinema can shield us from.

The way they look at one another is sexier than any of those very graphic \"love scenes\".  They make a real romantic connection just through their eyes.  Ghost not only has wonderful, likeable characters in Sam Wheat, Molly Jensen, and Oda Mae Brown, but it has an engrossing plot that moves right along.  Entwined in all this is a beautiful score.  The theme song \"Ghost\", written by Maurice Jarre specifically for the movie, is enchanting, and, of course, an oldie, \"Unchained Melody\", adds another magical touch to a magical film.',\n",
       " 'To start off with, I heard a lot of good things about this movie when it was on the big screens but never got around to see it before it disappeared. Sitting here, long after in the aftermath, I might never forgive myself for missing that opportunity. Eventually I did get around to see it, though a small TV never does a film the same justice a theater does, and being a bit sceptic about the small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it, but I must say I have never been so wrong before. And I am happy saying it.This movies biggest crime, and yet its biggest asset, is that it is in French. Subtitles just does not bring full justice to a movie like this, and it is bound to scare off most of the audience not used to subtitled movies. Sad to say so, but I believe it is the truth. I do not know any French at all, but I sure wish I was fluent watching this movie!Compared to most other films \"Amelie\" (and I will stick to \"Amelie\" since \"Le Fabuleux destin d\\'Amélie Poulain\" is a bit long to write) is based on a rather ordinary and plain story everyone can relate to, but it is given to us in a very special kind of way, mixed with wonderful little subplots and an almost chaotic amount of details. We get to see and experience the world and especially Paris through the filtering eyes and fantasy of Amelie, A Paris that might feel small and limited on the screen but in fact is just as big as it is in the eyes of Amelie.Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet brings to life the world of Amelie with colors, masterful camerawork and a few special effects (Well, I have certainly felt like melting a couple of times too in my life!). Some people I spoke to before seeing \"Amelie\" criticized it for being too childish and unrealistic, but I believe it is an essential part of the movie since Amelie herself is a very childish and imaginative young girl. She just happens to fall in love one day when she decides to embark on a quest. Jean-Pierre Jeunet manages to bring us along without losing control of the set or the plot. It is exactly this kind of movie that could easily be overdone and lose all of its magic in the hands of the wrong person, but Jean-Pierre Jeunet never slips a single time. For you who think you never heard of him before he is actually the same man who brought us \"Alien 4\" back in 1997, (I still refuse to believe he was involved in that horrible film...), and the wonderful \"Delicatessen\" in 1991.Audrey Tautou could not be overemphasized for her importance in portraying Amelie. I am a bit embarrassed admitting it but I was almost falling in love with Amelie myself, forgetting she was only fiction on the screen. However she does not carry \"Amelie\" solely by herself. The cast makes an excellent whole and it is hard imagining switching anyone without affecting the whole outcome. Everyone manages to make the most out of their role and even though we only get to know some of them briefly they come alive just as much as Amelie herself does.I could go on forever about \"Amelie\". It contains so many details and switches in tempo and camerawork it has to be seen more than once to take in and understand everything. Damn it, \"Amelie\" made me happy, laughing out loud at times, and very few movies affects me like that.I very rarely give movies a 10, and I was indeed considering a 9 for a while, but for me this is one of those movies I will come back to time after time. Long after the CG thrills of hyped fantasy movies and big budget Hollywood productions have faded and been forgotten, Amelie will still be jumping around in my heart, doing all those silly and charming little things I wish I dared to do too...',\n",
       " 'Somewhere in the netherworld between being a \"remake\" and merely \"inspired by\" Mitchell Leisen\\'s 1934 film Death Takes a Holiday, Meet Joe Black is the story of Death personified. Death takes over the body of Brad Pitt\\'s unnamed character, later donned \"Joe Black\" by William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins). Although the motivation isn\\'t specified but implied in this film, Death wishes to experience the life he normally takes away--he wants to see what it\\'s like to be human. He chooses Parrish to be his guide because Parrish is a hugely successful media mogul who has conviction, strong \"moral fiber\" and insight on life. Compounding the situation, Parrish\\'s daughter, Susan (Claire Forlani), is a woman whom Brad Pitt\\'s unnamed character met in a coffee shop that morning and had an instant mutual attraction with. Black sticks close by William\\'s side through much of the film, creating difficult situations at a time when Parrish\\'s company is trying to deal with a financially attractive but ethically unsavory takeover bid, and he also puts the boil to somewhat strained familial relationships.First, a word of warning. This is a very long film (3 hours), and it tends to be very slowly paced. If you are averse to either, or if you do not like any of the three principals\\x97Pitt, Hopkins and Forlani--I\\'d advise you to avoid the film.For me, I never think that a film\\'s length is a problem in itself. As long as the film works, I\\'d be happy with it lasting 4, 5, even 12 hours or more--heck, I even gladly sat through Gettysburg (1993) in the theater. There have been films I\\'ve thought were too long (such as Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, 1962), but it\\'s contextual, not related to actual running time.Helmer Martin Brest directs with a lot of deliberation. Lines of dialogue and responses are stretched out to \"infinity and taken to the depth of forever\". The camera gives us lots of lingering gazes. There is little to no \"action\" in the film. Much of it is similar to David Lynch\\'s famed pregnant pauses. Some people hate that style. I love it (although I love other styles, too--I like variety), and for me, the pacing makes this film seem much shorter than its actual running time. It\\'s the complete opposite of the pacing of, say, Medallion (2003), which is interesting given that both films feature Forlani. It\\'s also interesting to note that Brest\\'s career seems to match the pacing of Meet Joe Black. He\\'s taken 2, 4, 5 and 6 years between films. Obviously, Brest is not in a rush.If you watch Meet Joe Black immediately after watching Death Takes a Holiday, as I did this time around, a few things might strike you as odd and slightly negative at first. The principal difference that had this initial effect on me was the change in the primary romantic relationship--between Joe and Susan (and between Prince Sirki (Frederic March) and Grazia (Evelyn Venable) in the original). In the original, it\\'s ambiguous whether Grazia doesn\\'t recognize Sirki for what he really is all along. She at least never meets him as Sirki rather than Death-as-Sirki. It creates interesting philosophical scenarios about humankind\\'s conception and fear of death; Grazia, who is a bit aloof all along, may be embracing death rather than fearing it, not as something negative, but more metaphysically, as inherent in the idea of life.In Meet Joe Black, Susan falls for Pitt as another character first. It removes all of the philosophical points about one\\'s attitude towards death (with the exception of William, who is the only one who knows the truth, even in the end, and who implicitly goes through vacillating feelings about death). However, despite my initial hesitation on the change, I tried to remember my commitment to judge each film on its own terms rather than its relation to other works, and I realized that the relationship set up here is interesting for another reason--it explores public identity in relationships and the tensions that arise through dynamicism of that public identity. That\\'s a theme throughout the film, not just in its romantic relationships.Pitt has often been criticized for his performance here, but in my opinion, it\\'s perfect for the character(s)--just as good in its own way as March\\'s turn as Sirki in the original. Once Pitt as Death takes over \"Joe Black\\'s\" body, he _must_ change his persona in the way he does. He\\'s supposed to be a supernatural being who normally relates to the world in a completely different way, but now he\\'s suddenly made corporeal. He doesn\\'t know what to do as a human. As an entity, he\\'s not daft, lacking power or unknowledgeable about many things, but he\\'s incredibly naïve and awkward as a thing of flesh. He\\'s not used to relating to the world in that way. He\\'s not used to making facial expressions. He\\'s never tasted food, and so on. The change he undergoes in the beginning and end of the film is amazing and shows just how skilled Pitt is.Hopkins and Forlani are of course no slouches, either. Hopkins\\' ability to go from understated and elegant to manic is put to good use; the role seems tailor-made for him. Forlani, who has a very unusual but intriguingly beautiful face that always looks a bit pouty, gets to pout even more, creating a bizarrely complex but effective character. The rest of the primary cast is just as good. The end result is a strangely dysfunctional family with a lot of depth.While I can see people preferring Death Takes a Holiday to this film, for me, Meet Joe Black is slightly better. It\\'s much more epic, of course, and that scope, plus the incredible score by Thomas Newman, pushes its emotional effectiveness up a notch. But make sure you do not miss either film. Both are excellent and unusual.',\n",
       " 'As I was walking down the stairs and out of the theater, I was trying as hard as I could to pull a smile out of my face. My friends tensely asked if I liked it, I said \"Yes, of course!!\" They nodded weakly in response. On the way home, I kept thinking to myself. \"You liked it! C\\'mon! It\\'s Spiderman!\" Now, it\\'s two days later, the euphoria of waiting for Spidey to come out has subsided, and I\\'ve begun to look at this flick a bit more (shall I say it?) critically.It\\'s plain to see that Sam Raimi is a fantastic director. He knows when to do what and realizes that he is making a superhero movie, which is why the Spider-man movies have done so well. It\\'s not like the recent Batman and Superman who try to hide the fact that they\\'re just fun superhero films. Raimi knows his material and embraces it. The effects were astounding as usual. Spiderman\\'s one-on-one fight with the Sandman and the crane scene being the major highlights. I thought these features would outbalance the weaker spots of the film, but unfortunately they did not.As far as acting goes, I\\'m surprised to say that Topher Grace stole the show. I remember how outraged everyone was when he was chosen, but obviously someone knew what they were doing when they let him on as Venom. James Franco and Kirsten Dunst played their usual selves (I can\\'t help but think of Dunst dreaming of getting back to work with Sofia Coppola while doing these films). However, Tobey Maguire REALLY disappointed me. I\\'ve always thought he was so great at Spidey, which is undeniable in the first two films and even in this one...when he has his red suit on. Maguire is a one note actor, at least as far as Spidey goes. He just could not pull off the black suit; he wasn\\'t good at being bad. Then came the horrific bridge scene with MJ. Along with most other people I\\'ve talked to, my entire theater erupted in laughter when he started crying. It was just...sad...and not in the way the writers intended it.Speaking of the writing, I hate to be beating a dead horse, but c\\'mon: 3 villains, Sandman\\'s background, trouble with MJ, Harry\\'s changing attitudes, 2 different Spidermans, competition at the Bugle, Gwen Stacy, etc. It was just WAY TOO MUCH! Even if you had four hours, it\\'s just too much to cram into the audience in one sitting. The great thing about Spiderman 2 (the best of the trilogy) is how focused it was. You had the inner struggle, the villain and his relationship with MJ. There it was! Beautifully filmed and written. From the first 15 minutes of Spiderman 3, I knew that all these parallel story lines were going to crash within the next two hours. The sequence that shows how far they\\'ve fallen from part two is the whole emo/hair in the eyes/eyeliner/oh so cool \"bad\" Spiderman scenes. The first few minutes of this was funny in the same way that the \"Raindrops are Falling on my Head\" scene in part two was great, but this time they stretched a good thing way too far. This whole sequence is what sticks in my mind and refuses to let me think that the film was just as great as the rest.I tried to like it! I really did! I just can\\'t fool myself any longer. Some critics like Peter Travers for Rolling Stone are saying that we can let this one slide because it\\'s Spiderman, but I couldn\\'t disagree more. Spiderman 3 missed the mark and, deep down inside, we all know it.',\n",
       " 'An individual\\'s life is formed by his memories. Books, music and - yes, movies - influence us. We remember the situations and the dialogue, we remember the sweet melodies. These memories enable us to react, as well as give us the ability to identify situations as they occur.I saw \"Raintree County\" when I was 15. Orphaned at six, I\\'d just departed from an orphans home in Dallas, after nearly nine years. Knowing virtually nothing of the outside world, I was receptive to everything, every person that I encountered. That summer of 1958, I sneaked into the Forest Park Drive-In to see Elizabeth Taylor, of whom I knew little, other than that she was a breath-taking beauty, and had been recently widowed when Michael Todd\\'s chartered plane had crashed.The characters in the movie (when I was 15) were literal, if not visceral: the magnificence of Miss Taylor\\'s satin gowns encased over crinoline, Lee Marvin\\'s sharp, smart-alecky wit, the professor\\'s lechery, Montgomery Clift\\'s Yankee stoicism, Agnes Moorehead\\'s curious detachment, were all primary colors. Forty-five years have passed.  Those primary colors are now a multitude of blendings and shadings of secondary colors. Montgomery Clift\\'s character is now a beautifully controlled young man who reflects his parents\\' stoicism, a young man whose intelligence and self control are at the core of the film, and upon whom all characters revolve.Originally, I thought that \"Raintree County\" was strictly Taylor\\'s vehicle. She is the burr under the saddle, the exquisite seductress that interfers with Clift\\'s heretofore regulated, almost predestined lifestyle upon his college graduation.\\'Raintree\\' is an achingly beautiful film, and Miss Taylor, who is the most gifted in her portrayal of anguished characters, blesses the movie. Norma Shearer could be beautiful in \\'Marie Antoinette\", but she lacked depth. Betty Davis portrayed Sturm und Drang, but was never a clothes horse. Taylor combines the two.Having read some of the other\\'s comments, most of whom disliked the story, perhaps it helps to be Southern to truly love this film. And also, one wants to realize that it depicts two diametrically opposed cultures: North and South. When Northern chill mixes with Southern humidity, chaos results. And so it did, and it was known as The War Between the States.In conclusion, one wants to luxuriate in this film: Lockridge wrote a brilliant story, and for the most part, it is well delivered. It is rich in history and characterization.',\n",

This is the movie we, all the fans wanted and deserve.',\n",
       " \"When The Mummy hit theatres in 1999, critics everywhere panned it as being a poor man's Indiana Jones. While the two movies are about as similar as Dr. No is to GoldenEye (thankfully), I suppose comparisons between one non-stop adventure film and other are inevitable. In the end, what really counts when determining a film's quality is the level to which it can entertain. And if there is one thing The Mummy did well, it was entertain. Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and Arnold Vosloo were very well chosen for their roles.The Mummy Returns is easy to see as being another sequel churned out to satiate the greedy money-machine that Hollywood has become, but it has a few things working for it. One thing that is immediately obvious is that the sequel was very much intended to be a film that could be enjoyed without ever having seen the original. The only references to the previous film are done to fill in the narrative gaps about who Imhotep is, and why he is the way he is. The addition of The Scorpion King was an interesting effort to give the film a new antagonist, but the lack of screentime didn't work well in this tangent's favour. Another tangent that could have been better developed was the rivalry between Imhotep's girlfriend and whatever her name was. Imhotep originally mistook Rachel Weisz's character for being his girlfriend reincarnated, so the use of a woman who looks exactly like her while creating this new tangent needed to be developed differently.Most people won't give a damn about complex story tangents and will want to know if this film is entertaining. And it is entertaining, alright. There is barely a dull moment in the film's substantial running length, and Oded Fehr does a bang-up job of providing a Mad-Max-cum-Indiana-Jones hero. I want to know where they get those groovy costumes and tattoos from, they look quite nice. Anyway, when all is said and done, this is an eight out of ten film. A few badly constructed story details here and there, but some extremely entertaining action sequences make up for them. Don't listen to the nay-sayers. This is matinee-style material at its (almost) best. Get the DVD when it comes out, it will at least tide you over until George Lucas gets his head out of his proverbial and realises that the VHS era is well and truly over.\",\n",
       " '\"Blue Beetle\" is simply B or even C grade super hero movie with some charm along the way. I don\\'t think it will be realistic to expect something else to be honest. The trailers showed that pretty well in my opinion.The tone of the movie is close to that of \"Shazam!\", given the fact that the family got bigger role in it again, that said the story is not all that good. Not that \"Shazam!\" got some epic story, but I think it was one idea better.The cast is fine, maybe the best part of the movie is the family dynamic, except when they lean too much to the melodrama side. Xolo Maridueña as Jaime/Blue Beetle and George Lopez are the standouts no doubt.The villain is everything you ca expect from B grade super hero movie, from the introduction, through his motivation, the fights and the conclusion is nothing particularly memorable.I must say the suit looks great when is practical and not CGI all over the place. There are some cool fight scenes with our protagonist, most of which are shown in the trailers, which is kinda of a shame.There are plenty of jokes in the movie, but for me, most of them doesn\\'t land. I mean they are too childish. I guess the younger auditory will laugh out hard, but me and my cinema crowd were silent most of the time. Of course there were funny moments, but don\\'t expect \"Deadpool\" level laughs if you are a bit older.The movie is not bad, but it\\'s kinda cringe, predictable and given the fact that the audience know this genre already, they expect something more clever, which sadly to report \"Blue Beetle\" is not.There are already enough talks about the future of this character, is it part of the DCEU or DCU, will there be a sequel, or the character will transfer in the newly formed universe? If you ask me, there will not be a second movie, because this one will bomb hard, also, I\\'m not sure how you can do clean slate without the bagage of the previous universe, when you always lean to what was, not what it can be. In other words there is always a chance to see Blue Beetle again, but who will portray it and will the origin story be 1:1 identical is something I\\'m not sure about and I don\\'t hold my breath for it.In conclusion the movie is \"okay\", got its moments, but there is nothing really memorable, also there are two credit scenes, which are fine I guess.',\n",
       " 'Who says popular films are not and cannot be art? If anything is proof that popular films can be of a stunningly high quality, the beauty of the animation, writing, music, and sound design in \"WALL·E\" is it. \"WALL·E\" eclipses even Andrew Stanton\\'s \"Toy Story\" and \"Toy Story 2\" in the Pixar pantheon, is perhaps Pixar\\'s best film to date and, call me crazy as I\\'ve just seen it, a contender for the title of best animated film, period.\"WALL·E\" is everything we\\'ve come to expect from Pixar and more- colorful, vibrant, imaginative, exciting, involving, beautiful, and most importantly a film with interesting, involving characters. Sure, WALL·E is adorable, and as much credit as the animators get for that, this film would be nothing without Stanton\\'s screenplay, which features very little dialogue but is still notably intelligent and surprisingly subtle, making a refreshing change from the \\'go green\\' campaigns we\\'re all so used to. Does \"WALL·E\" have a message? Sure, but it\\'s an important message and it is delivered subtly and beautifully.\"WALL·E\" operates on two levels (and works spectacularly well on both). It is a majestic science fiction epic like we haven\\'t seen in a couple of decades and it is a genuinely touching and never cheap romance. \"WALL·E\" will never get points for originality but it doesn\\'t exactly need them because the homages to great films and figures of the past- Chaplin, Keaton, Tati, the Marx Brothers, \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (this one is particularly spectacular), \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" are actually homages and not ripoffs. \"WALL·E\" is a wonderful tribute to a bygone cinematic tradition (well, two or three of them actually). The social commentary in \"WALL·E\" is sobering because it\\'s never overbearing and most importantly because we see the world through machines, machines who feel more about Earth and life than the humans do. The depiction of humans on the ship could have been incredibly offensive, cheap, and tasteless in concept but the execution here is absolutely perfect.What is most surprising about \"WALL·E\" is how sad it is. Not even in the \\'how will they get out of this, oh I feel so sorry for them\\' way \"Finding Nemo\", a previous Stanton effort, is, but in a truly melancholy sense. The early portion of the film maintains all the playfulness of a Jacques Tati film but also evokes a striking and powerful feeling of loneliness. It\\'s a brilliant introduction to WALL·E, given that the rest of the film is too wacky to bother with long scenes focused entirely on character, and works beautifully with the ugly yet beautifully-rendered future Earth, a barren wasteland filled with nothing but garbage, a seriously resilient cockroach being WALL·E\\'s only companion before EVE shows up, but I won\\'t go into the story- it\\'s best you see it unfold for yourself.From the entertaining shorts shown before the film to the memorable characters, locations, and animation we have come to expect, Pixar films are now event cinema, and they have outdone themselves with \"WALL·E\". This film is spectacular, majestic, touching, involving, and achingly beautiful. Most importantly, however, it is perfect entertainment. I may be saying this too soon, but I don\\'t think I have ever seen an animated film that has satisfied me more than \"WALL·E\", and 2008 is going to have to work hard to keep this from being the top film of the year, which it most certainly is at the moment.9.5/10',\n",
       " \"I was lucky enough to see a preview of Half-Blood Prince three days before opening day. I saw it a second time with my son who is not quite ten, but who is generally mature for his age and doesn't scare easily. The two viewings give me the unique advantage of both the adult and the child perspective on the movie. I only recently started counting myself a true Harry Potter fan after my son introduced me to the movies a couple of years ago. I finished the last book only three weeks before seeing the movie adaptation of Half-Blood Prince the first time.With all the book details very fresh in my mind, I had high expectations of the movie. And Yates, the production crew and the cast definitely delivered. The movie impresses on many levels from an artistic point of view. The stripped landscapes and washed out colors convey a constant feeling of dread and foreboding. The standard train trip to Hogwarts was particularly stark, seen against a landscape scorched by a hot summer sun and dotted with dark pools of water. The usual lush greenery and joyous train ride are nowhere to be seen.Personally, I felt the pace was spot-on and that the movie elegantly made time for all key plot points. But only if you enjoy a plot line driven by character and emotion. For the younger lot, looking for frightening wizard duels and attacks by magical creatures, the first hour and a half of the movie drags on a bit. My son certainly became fidgety, and didn't appreciate the finesse and sophistication of the plot and cinematic approach.Most of the threatening and darkening tone of the movie was also lost upon him, whereas I reveled in the finer details contributing to a general sense of ever-encroaching darkness. There are worse things in life to be afraid of than big hairy spiders. My son missed seeing those - I was a lot more intrigued by the ominous undercurrents made palpable by the indomitable trio of David Yates (director), Steve Kloves (screenplay) and Delbonnel (photography).Some people feel that the romantic comedy aspects played too large a role in the movie, but I felt this aspect added some much-needed lightness and human drama to the movie. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) all find themselves dealing with the vagaries of young love - from dealing with unwanted advances to finding love in unexpected places. The romance was aimed perfectly at the young teen market, and I found myself cringing ruefully at some of Lavender Brown's love-obsessed stunts and smiling wistfully at the tenderness between Harry and Ginny. Haven't we all been there at some stage of our lives?All in all, Harry Potter is growing up. And so is the market for these movies. If you've seen all the movies up to now or read all the books, and your are at an age to appreciate the adult themes and movie techniques, this movie should fall pitch-perfect on your ear. You are likely to leave the cinema filled with a heart-wrenching sadness for innocence lost. Purist fans will most certainly complain bitterly about numerous sub-plots, events and characters that were cut from the movie and the odd scene that doesn't exist in the book. But Yates' truly gutsy adaptation really works and brings a depth and clarity to the main themes of the book that is quite extraordinary. He manages to capture the lingering lightness of that time before the serious business of adulthood sets in, alongside the relentless buildup to the final showdown between The Dark Lord and The Chosen One. And the lack of closure at the end of the movie is no accident, I believe. Just like the book, this movie leaves you aching to see how it all ends (never mind the fact that you already know).I must also commend the acting. The young leads have all matured in pace with the maturing content of the books and their acting shows it. Rupert Grint shines brightly in the somewhat Shakespearean love comedy he finds himself in, and makes the most of his new-found sport hero popularity. Emma Watson hits the spot, portraying Hermione's emotional vulnerability with gentle confidence and softness.As for Radcliffe, it's easy to miss the evolution he's undergone as Harry, since there are other actors ostensibly given more to do in this outing, like Tom Felton and Bonnie Wright, both of whom get the opportunity to take their characters to a new level. Tom Felton, especially, does a remarkable job. But Radcliffe's task of playing the steadfast and courageous, yet not flashy or arrogant hero, remains a difficult one. Especially on second viewing, it becomes clear how his understated and controlled performance speaks very much to the type of man Harry Potter is shaping up to be. A man who is left with a tremendous responsibility at the end of this movie and takes it up without flinching. The boy-wizard is no more.Of the older guard, Alan Rickman's Snape was a consummate performance, ... obviously. And Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore never felt more right than in this movie. Jim Broadbent's Slughorn is deliciously played with just the right mix of off-putting sycophancy and endearing pathos.All in all - a triumph all around!\",\n",
       " \"There is only one movie in history that I can name that my wife, my mother and my six-year-old daughter enjoyed equally. This is it.This is an astonishly effective and pleasant remake of a very good film. It's light, romantic, touching and downright funny. You cannot pour enough accolades on young Lindsay Lohan, who effortlessly plays both twins, and, if you listen closely, juggles four accents. (She changes her Brit accent when she plays her own American alter-ego pretending to be herself in England - if you saw the film, you know what I mean).Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid with that big, goofy, infectious smile, give the film its romance and maturity, without stepping on the fun-filled kid's plot. This is simple, easy-to-watch family entertainment.There is also a great editing and effects element. You never once notice a split screen or cheap over-the-shoulder shot when both of Lohan's characters are on-screen - its really quite astounding how seamless it is.My daughter, after seeing this in the theater, quickly proclaimed this her favourite movie ever. We own the video, and I have watched it with her at least a dozen times without growing tired.A perfect rental after a bad day, or when you want to have a family movie night. *** out of ****.\",\n",
       " \"A dazzlingly complex film, `Traffic' takes a hard, unflinching look at the so-called `war on drugs' that is perfectly clear and uncompromising. Director Steven Soderbergh takes the various viewpoints of the drug culture -- the users, the dealers, the police, and the politicians -- and weaves their differing stories together into a single story that is both deep in its ideas but very simple to understand.  In terms of story, direction, and characters, `Traffic' is easily Soderbergh's best film to date, and one of the best films made in recent years, period.`Traffic' takes a look at the world of drugs through the stories and lives of different characters.  Some are loosely connected to one another; some are not.  There is the story of Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), a Mexican policeman struggling to keep his distance from the corruption that seems to follow him everywhere; there is the story of Ray Castro (Luis Guzman) and Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle), two DEA agents trying to turn the low-level drug dealer Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer) against his drug cartel boss; there's the story of Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the unsuspecting wife of the drug cartel boss who suddenly learns who her husband really is and what he does for a living; and then there's the new head of the DEA, Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), a man so wrapped up in his mission to stop the war on drug, he fails to notice that his own daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is becoming addicted to crack.  Much like in the real world, the events of each story directly or indirectly affect the events of the others, leaving all the characters to consider their roles in the drug culture . . . and what, if anything, they can do to change those roles.In terms of story, `Traffic' is absolutely brilliant.  I'm still amazed that the film could cover so many plotlines and dozens of characters so effortlessly.  Each story -- whether it's Helena assuming the role of her drug-dealing husband, or Robert canceling DEA meetings so he can deal with his drug-addicted daughter -- is powerful and brutally honest.  `Traffic' isn't afraid to look at tough or uncomfortable issues.  `Traffic', somewhat surprisingly, never preaches, either -- while it's safe to say that the message of the film is essentially anti-drug, it never comes out and outright says that message.  A lesser film would've had some grandiose speech imbedded somewhere in the film denouncing the use of drugs -- not `Traffic'.  It's wise enough to let the viewer take what messages they want from the film, without ever preaching.  (A minor quibble -- did Michael Douglas' character really have to be the new drug czar of the United States? The fact that he was the top law enforcement drug official in the U.S., and that his daughter was addicted to drug . . . well, it seemed a little too far-fetched, and a little too movie-like.  If Mr. Douglas had been playing ONE of the top drug officials in the federal government, instead of THE top official, I would've found his character to be infinitely more believable.)Soderbergh's also at the top of his game with his direction of `Traffic'. The film is virtually filmed entirely with hand-held camera, giving each and every scene an up-close-and-personal feel.  There's also a distinct lack of background music, which lets the viewer feel like they're eavesdropping on real-life scenes, and not just watching a movie.  These techniques make for a very personal, intense experience.  Soderbergh also uses a technique he's used in some of his other films (Out of Sight, Erin Brockovich) -- certain scenes are filtered a specific color, to heighten a mood or a sense of awareness of what's about to happen.  The scenes in Mexico featuring the Mexican detective Javier, for example, are all filmed in a very bright, almost disorienting yellow.  It's a technique that can be irritating at times, but for the most part, it serves a bold purpose that truly adds to the film.As for the characters, and the acting . . . jeez, `Traffic' is without a doubt one of the best-cast films of all time.  I mean it.  There are no weak links, no poorly written characters, and no badly played characters.  Each and every character adds something significant to the story in `Traffic', and each and every actor is outstanding.  Kudos must go to possibly one of the best ensemble casts of all time.  Three actors in particular stand out, though -- Benicio Del Toro (who won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance), Don Cheadle (who was actually slightly better than the brilliant performance of Mr. Del Toro, IMHO), and Catherine Zeta-Jones. I'm normally loathe to use the word `flawless' when describing a film, but the casting of `Traffic' was indeed flawless.`Traffic', with its unflinching look at drug use in America today, can be uncomfortable at times to watch.  It certainly can't be termed a `happy' or a `feel-good' film.  That doesn't change the fact that it is an amazing, thought-provoking, powerful film -- and without a doubt the best film released in the year 2000.  I can't recommend this film enough.

       " 'Prior to seeing this movie, all I had heard suggested that I was better off not watching it unless it was to ridicule. I looked at my uncle dancing round his living room to some of its music and asked myself if anybody expected me to take that seriously. It\\'s got a place in movie history even for the title song alone, though, so I decided I couldn\\'t live with myself unless I gave it a chance. It was definitely worth it.The style is reminiscent of a whole host of other \\'80\\'s teen flicks, but only a handful are better. Most of the cast do great things with their roles. Kevin Bacon actually manages to make the clichéd concept seem kinda cool, here showcasing an easy charm that was to become the hallmark of much of his later work. Crucially, the music is actually pretty good too! (Even if I am torn between wanting to cringe and dance when I hear the theme!)On reflection it\\'s no cheesier than something like \"All the Right Moves\" (which has a great cast doing their best but suffers from a plodding story) In fact, it\\'s miles better! At least the music in \"Footloose\" gave the makers a viable way to pep things up whenever the story begins to flag. This film is much, MUCH better than I had been led to believe, so give it a chance if you ain\\'t seen it yet but thought you knew the score. Chances are, you don\\'t...',\n",
       " 'A controversial and shocking movie? Definitely, and the way some people today profess to be jaded about \"The Night Porter\" says more about our current culture than about the movie itself. Other persons who experienced the Holocaust first-hand have reacted negatively towards it for its portrayal of a destructive but loving relationship born amidst the Holocaust. Their objections are certainly understandable. There has also been, though, an awful lot of politically-correct garbage and pretentious nonsense written about \"The Night Porter,\" much of which has missed or misinterpreted some of the strongest elements of the movie.When I first saw \"The Night Porter\" in the early 1980\\'s, it certainly had the power to shock me and many others, yet at the same time it offered a depth of aesthetic experience well beyond just shock for its own sake. These aesthetic qualities produce a sense of doom and sadness, yet also show beauty and love amidst the hopelessness.Dirk Bogarde gives a really masterful performance as Max, a former Nazi SS man who bears a huge burden of guilt. After World War II, Max works at the main desk of a gorgeous old hotel in Vienna. Here he re-encounters Lucia, who survived the Nazi concentration camps, where she was a victim of Max\\'s sadism. Bogarde\\'s Max, and Charlotte Rampling as Lucia, do not say a word at first during their unexpected postwar encounter in the hotel, yet their understated expressiveness speaks paragraphs. The most controversial parts of the movie show the sort of sado-masochistic relationship which the two resume soon afterwards. While this relationship is very disturbing, with Max\\'s sometimes cruel nature and the destructiveness of the mutual attraction, there is also a kind of love expressed by the two towards each other. Lucia is certainly a victim, yet she also consciously holds a power over Max. The sado-masochism is not glamourized, and I don\\'t see any suggestion that these two lovers are any sort of role models. Yet they also evoke sympathy.Throughout the movie, Bogarde is able to show a wide range of thoughts and emotions by just a slight movement of the corner of his mouth, or by the raising of an eyebrow. Rampling shows vulnerability and also the power that she has over Max. She sometimes appears like a sleek, sly cat, and at other times clearly like the victim of the camp horrors. Other actors such as Philippe Leroy, Isa Miranda and Amedeo Amodio also do a nice and sometimes subtle job of expressing the psychic state of their characters. Another character, an Italian who survived awful times, appears like a dog who has been beaten and fears another whipping.\"The Night Porter\" can be slow-moving, yet this is punctuated by some very vivid scenes. For me, the most striking one is a flashback to a time during the war when Bert, a Nazi associate of Max, puts on a performance for a group of SS men and women, to the accompaniment of some gorgeous classical music. Not only does the scene seem to have a very sinister quality, but Amodio as Bert expresses an emotional longing which has important repercussions. There is also another very eerie flashback showing a musical, cabaret-style performance by Lucia for her SS captors. Something of the corruption, moral bankruptcy and hopelessness of Nazism is conjured up by this scene.On the downside, some of the minor characters are portrayed in a caricaturish way, the voice dubbing can be off-putting, and some plot elements towards the end of the movie are at times very silly. Through those failures, though, I think the movie still succeeds aesthetically. Partly this is due to the appealing yet melancholy and ominous musical score by Daniele Paris and others, the disturbing magnetism of Max and Lucia, and the cinematography. Throughout the movie the beautiful, fascinating city of Vienna almost seems a character in itself.\"The Night Porter\" is certainly not for everyone. In addition to its portrayal of a very disturbing, unconventional love relationship, it has a few brief scenes of graphic sex, and small bits of the ugliness of the camps. For those who don\\'t mind getting through those parts, its aesthetic qualities can be very rewarding. Be warned though that the movie contains much ugliness along with its beauty. As Lucia says to someone who is trying to use pschoanalytical games to avoid his guilt and shame, \"There is no cure.\"',\n",
       " 'Mel Brooks\\' parodies are like your favorite, worn-out couch.  You know it\\'s not the greatest in style, taste and quality, but it just feels so damn comfortable.  Of late, most of Mel\\'s spoofs have been off the mark, his work mellowing into predictability.  In fact, you really have to go all the way back to 1974 to see Brooks at his sharpest.  In that year we were awarded \"Blazing Saddles\" AND \"Young Frankenstein.\"Perhaps \"Young Frankenstein\" is not definitive Mel Brooks, although he directed it.  Gene Wilder, who not only stars but co-wrote it with Mel, was the inspiration to make this movie.  And it\\'s his influence, I think, that brings the best out in Mel.  When spoofing a historical era, movie genre or legendary tale, Brooks\\' satirical bag of tricks always included a hodgepodge of crude sight gags, burlesque schtick and stale Jewish jokes done at rapid-fire pace.  The plot became an after-thought, working around the barrage of unsubtle humor.  In targeting the classic \\x91Frankenstein\\' series, however, Brooks worked in reverse, wisely focusing on plot, tone and atmosphere, then complementing them with clever, carefully constructed bits.A rich staple of comedy pros from Brooks\\' fun factory (Mel graciously did not cast himself here) were employed to wring out the most laughs possible out of the fresh, inventive material.  Gene Wilder plays the frizzy-haired, eruptive college professor Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced FRONK-en-STEEN), grandson of the infamous scientist, who gives in to the maniacal tendencies of his mad ancestor after inheriting the late Baron\\'s Teutonic castle.  His simmer-to-boil antics have seldom been put to better use, while only pop-eyed Marty Feldman, who gets to break the fourth wall as Igor (prounouced EYE-gor), the dim, oddball assistant, could milk a hump for all its worth.  Kenneth Mars too gets a lot of mileage out of his one-armed, slush-mouthed inspector.  In the film\\'s most difficult role, Peter Boyle\\'s appearance as the Monster is jarring at first, looking like a cross between Herman Munster and Uncle Fester.  But he increasingly wins you over, earning even a little empathy along the way.  His character is the most crucial for this parody to work right and he succeeds, figuring in a high percentage of the comedy highlights.Representing the distaff side, Madeline Kahn is one cool cucumber, stealing focus whenever she\\'s on camera as the placid, meticulous, hopelessly stuck-up fiancee Elizabeth; Cloris Leachman sinks her teeth into the role of the grotesque Frau Blücher, whose mere mention of her name sends horses into panic; and Teri Garr is delightful as a dinghy Deutschlander who assists Frankenstein in his wild experiments and other things.An amalgamation of Universal\\'s earliest and best \\x91Frankenstein\\' movies (\"Frankenstein,\" \"Bride of Frankenstein\" and \"Son of Frankenstein,\" this spoof relies on close imitation and Brooks took painstaking methods to recreate the look and feel of James Whale\\'s original sets, black-and-white photography and musical score.  It pays off in spades.Nearly 30 years later, this movie still leaves me in stitches.  Wilder and Garr\\'s revolving secret door bit is still priceless, as is Cloris Leachman\\'s \\x91ovaltine\\' routine and the Wilder/Boyle \"Puttin\\' On the Ritz\" tie-and-tail duet.  Boyle and the unbilled Gene Hackman in the \"Blind Hermit\" scene ripped off from \"Bride of Frankenstein\" are uproarious, easily winning the award for sustained hilarity in a single sketch.  Add Feldman\\'s hump and Mars\\' troublesome mechanical arm and what you have is rib-tickling entertainment from start to finish.  Madeline Kahn\\'s post-coital, cigarette-smoking scene with \\x91ol zipperneck\\' who leaves her in a sexual snit must go down in Hollywood annals as the funniest scene ever caught on camera.  Certainly Jeanette MacDonald\\'s puristic rendition of \"Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life\" will never have quite the same meaning again after you\\'ve heard Madeline\\'s spin on it. \"Blazing Saddles\" indeed has its insane moments but when it comes to toasting Mel Brooks in the years to come, \"Young Frankenstein\" should certainly stand front and center when representing this clown prince of comedy.',\n",
       " \"There has been next to no fanfare for the release of this murder mystery. Which is surprising, considering the talent involved in front of the camera (Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen) and behind it (writer-director Taylor Sheridan). Fresh from joining the ranks of top-tiered screenwriters after the amazing one-two punch of Sicario and Hell or High Water, Sheridan continues his stellar run with a heart-wrenching study of loss and grief wrapped in a taut crime thriller narrative. Also having a crack at directing, Sheridan allows the snowy Wyoming setting to completely envelope the characters in a world that feels like it has no exits, both physically and emotionally. When this Native American community is hit with a homicide it feels like another tragedy in a long line of tragedies; their shock is replaced with deeper sorrow, their outrage is replaced with solemn defeat. Entering the scene like a fish out of water, Olsen's junior FBI agent Jane Banner must traverse the tricky cultural complexities if she's to understand the clues in front of her. Luckily she has Renner's local hunter Cory Lambert to assist, himself battling with a past family disaster. Renner and Olsen are both in terrific form, the former hiding his grief under a stoic veneer, the latter balancing big-city attitude with a genuine desire to find justice for the victim. Veteran character actor Gil Birmingham is also superb as a father unsure of how to deal with his earth-shattering loss. If this all sounds a bit heavy, well it is, but Sheridan's careful to inject a healthy dose of suspense and mild action to keep the drama gripping rather than overbearing; the finale in particular turns the movie on its head in an unpredictable but extremely effective manner. An intelligent, slow burning and provocative viewing that enthrals from start to finish, Wind River is an understated gem that deserves an audience.\",\n",
       " 'PPs (police procedurals) are a staple of the film/TV industry and are (believe it or not) as common as comedies or romcoms. However, within that category, \"big\" PPs based on big crimes are not that common. In fact, you would have to go back to the early 70s when a number of \"big PPs\" like Day of the Jackal 1973 were all the rage.So, a film like this done properly (and, trust me, this one is done perfectly) would be a treat all by itself. However, what makes this film extra-special is the extensive use of video footage.Now, to be clear, video footage as a plot device is not new by itself. It is now, and has been used extensively in British film and TV because, as we all know, London is the most \"surveyed\" city on the planet.But -- the point -- nothing the Brits have ever done with the forensic use of video comes even close to what Berg brings us in this excellent film. Much the same way that the original creators of CSI-Vegas introduced an entirely new sort of sub-genre, it can be argued that Patriots Day similarly has taken the police procedural to an entirely new level.The film itself? Brilliant! Berg has taken a stellar group of A-listers and make them work as a team, mirroring on the subliminal level the theme of the movie, which is both positive, and hopeful, and suggests that if we all work together, we can accomplish pretty much anything.',\n",

At first, I wasn\\'t excited to see it because I thought it would be just another cheesy romantic comedy, \"chick-flick\" if you will. I was wrong. \"27 Dresses\" was a romantic comedy everyone could enjoy. That\\'s right! I said EVERYONE (including guys).Katherine Heigl is great in the film as Jane, the optimistic bridesmaid who wants a shot of love for herself someday and feels the the 27 bridesmaid dresses she keeps in her closet is a calling that its time for her to get a dress of a different kind.Judy Greer, who\\'s always \"the best friend\" in the movies, is very comical and sassy as Katherine\\'s friend Casey. At least she knows what she wants, but she\\'s very compassionate and supportive to Jane throughout the film.One person, though, that I think stood out in this film, was James Marsden. I\\'ve always seen him in action movies (\"X-Men\" series and \"Superman Returns) as a minor or supporting character, but I think that he made the male lead of Kevin his own. Although he gets on Jane\\'s nerves half the time, he always tends to put on a smile on her face because she knows that he\\'s trying to get her to let go of the past and move on to a possible future where her big day might come. Kevin\\'s the guy you would want to confide in if something\\'s troubling you or if you need to dance to an Elton John song to get your groove back.If you should see any movie this new year, make a date with \"27 Dresses\".

The way he describes everything is so beautiful. Also, knowing the story from the perspective of certain characters made a strong connection between me and them.I read the book. It was awesome too. Some details were changed in the movie but were good changes and there are some details from the book I hoped the movie to show it and it didn't but that didn't affect the movie in a negative way. Everything was simple, clear and on point. The movie has strong messages about kindness, love, appreciating everyone for who they are and true friendship.Jacob Tremblay proves again his talent as an actor.

       " \"This is quite simply one of the best films of the year. Even the book's author, Lionel Shriver (a woman) praises the film, calling it 'a brilliant adaptation'. Being a first-time dad, the story fascinated me. What happens if you don't love your own child... and they know it? Tilda Swinton, not normally a favourite of mine, is exceedingly good as Eva, the mum uninterested in maternity. Gravid when she least wants to be (she's career-minded), out pops Kevin, her little Damien. You know from the moment she refuses skin-to-skin things are not going to bode well. She has no idea how to deal with a baby. Her idea of subduing him is to stand next to a pneumatic drill to drown out his relentless screaming. Kevin grows up knowing he is unloved and demonstrates this through devilish behaviour towards Eva. Gradually Eva, if not embraces motherhood, then at least gets better at it. Perhaps this is due to her giving birth to her second child, a girl, who Kevin of course hates with a passion. Or maybe the idea of being a mum sinks in, along with the realisation that a career is not the most important thing in life.Eva's betterments do nothing to placate Kevin: he gets worse. Eva's attempts to complain are met with ridicule by the father (John C. Reilly), who thinks she is delusional. Years of unintentional, but sometimes intentional, neglect take their toll on Kevin, and the film's tragic conclusion seems inevitable.The origin for Kevin's behaviour has polarised audiences. Did Eva create a monster by failing to form a bond early on? Should she have sought help from professionals if she felt she wasn't coping? Or was Kevin simply a bad seed; an innately evil child who no one could have cured? Now that I've had the chance to reflect, I think it's unfair to judge son or mother. I'd be surprised if Ramsay wanted audiences to do that. What would be the point? The film is a starkly brilliant exploration of a failed relationship and the consequences that has on a family and an entire community. If Swinton can win an Oscar so easily for her role in 'Michael Clayton', she should be celebrating her second win now. It's one of those performances which needs months of detoxification and psychoanalysis to move on from. Her acting is matched by new-kid-on-the-block Ezra Miller, who plays her lovelorn son. He brings to his role a controlled ferocity we are not used to seeing. His portrayal works, apart from his first-class acting, because he's not the stereotype. To look at him, you would say he was handsome and ingenuous. But looks are deceptive. It's hard for people to be repulsed by films nowadays, but there are scenes which will shock. So rare is it to see this kind of film. They vanish as quickly as they appear. I implore you to see this if you can. You'll be moved if not entertained.www.moseleyb13.com\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve never posted a comment regarding a movie but feel compelled to after attending a screening of Into The Wild at the Toronto Film Festival last night. I won\\'t speak to story here as it\\'s covered in the other comments.This is a movie of real beauty. It made me cry. I felt moved in a way that happens very rarely. It was an inspiration.The feelings it evoked were all based on the power of the acting and the writing. The words were real and human. The relationships seemed real and human. This may not seem like a great feat - but I consider it a true rarity. It didn\\'t feel calculated and artificial, like so many movies (read: Crash - but I\\'m not here to bash that...). It was very organic, natural and (I can\\'t say it enough) just beautiful. Cripes, it\\'s making me sound like a hippie, for heaven\\'s sake. This for me was Penn\\'s best work since Indian Runner.What it reminded me of...Terence Malik - Herzog? - in a strange way Cassavettes? - Hal Ashby (more Coming Home than Harold & Maude...) - even a bit of Ken LoachRuby in Paradise - Alice Doesn\\'t Live Here Anymore - Five Easy Pieces - Easy Rider... but when I list those it\\'s not because of plot similarities (though there are some) or style (although I think you can definitely see the influence of some great films) - it\\'s again because of the heart of it. I heard a few people at the screening comment that the film was \"too long\" but I don\\'t agree. I think exploring a journey of this magnitude required visiting all of the people he touched and taking the time to see the land.Hal Holbrook was just perfect, as was the cast as a whole, and I think Emile Hirsch is really going places - he was fantastic and he owned the role. Eddie Vedder\\'s music worked perfectly as well - not distracting or quirky - just a part of the whole.The film received a standing ovation and quite a few tears were shed. Magic.',\n",

Love that the film doesn\\'t have to show the already-known shocking scenes, but WE CAN SEE THEM just by looking at them through Kate\\'s gaze. This makes the film so powerful. Lee is not about the war. It\\'s about a beautiful woman who is also intelligent, genuine, and daring (thus Kate is perfectly cast as Lee Miller).

       " '\"Go\" reads like a very very good sophomore offering by a very very good up-and-coming director. You can almost see a bright future for everyone involved in the film, from the director (Doug Liman) to the screenwriter (John August) to all of the young actors. The script is clearly the winner, with witty dialogue and a convoluted plotline (or plotlines, depending on how you view it) centered around a dozen or so GenX-er Los Angelenos on Christmas Eve. The film slickly moves you from one plotline to the next, as you follow one minor disaster leading to other minor disasters.The film being a \"sophomore offering,\" of course, has some drawbacks. Yes, it is tangentially derivative of \"Pulp Fiction.\"  And yes, it does scrounge a bit from this teen flick and that.  In some cases, certain plotlines wrap up too neatly, and in other cases the plotlines don\\'t converge nearly as neatly enough. But what the film may lack in originality it certainly makes up for with style and quirks.The real discovery in all this is the cast. Sarah Polly stands out (listen to her mild Canadian accent slip through once in a while) as the world-weary checkout gal who\\'s first and only foray into drug-dealing unleashes a legion of trouble for her. Desmond Askew (wonderfully punny name) is this Pulp Fiction\\'s Tim Roth, glib and cocky as his well-ordered world whirls and crumbles around him in a neatly choreographed disaster.  As the sinister drug supplier, Timothy Olyphant is particularly menacing, exuding equal amounts of danger and innocence, sexiness and insecurity. The characters in \"Go\" never become cardboard parodies of themselves, and they never dissolve into charicatures of themselves for the sake of plot or atmosphere.So watch the film, soak in the plot, atmosphere, and the characters.  At the risk of sounding glib myself, by all means \"Go.\"',\n",

I loved the cast but I agree that characters were superficial and not defined as they should have been. I also feel more humor was needed in the movie. This can't compare to other Marvel movies. It's a one shot deal for us. We don't need to hear any more preaching.\",\n",
       " '\"The Edge\" is a terrific movie, not just as an action movie but as whole. I went to see this film because I thought it looked interesting, my expectations were shattered, this is a well written, well acted, well directed thriller. Anthony Hopkins as always turns in a great performance but the big suprise is Alec Baldwin who did just as well. This film has some of the best dialogue ever written for a movie of this type, and the action scenes are clever and blazingly paced. This is a terrific movie.',\n",
       " \"Once every few years, you're presented to a slapstick comedy so hilarious you instantly forget how LOW this form of entertainment actually is. I can't give a scientific explanation to state how come it's funny to see someone (preferably wearing glasses) getting hit in the face by a ball\\x85it just is. Dodgeball is vulgar, crude and without substance\\x85but your stomach will hurt from laughing and don't we all need that from time to time? In case you really want to defend this film, you can always say it features tons of unsubtle criticism towards modern American image of exaggerated health-obsession. Ben Stiller's character is the personification of the obnoxious fitness guru: 'We're better than you, and we know it'. Opposed to him, there's Vince Vaughn as the chilled-minded, lovable guy who owns a fitness center for the underdeveloped wimps. Due to his financial situation, he risks losing his gym to Stiller except if he and his teams of misfits manage to win the world-famous dodgeball tournament. The film is a series of cheap chuckles, eccentric characters and outrageous one-liners. It's pretty funny to hear Stiller yell out lines like: 'You're a skid mark on the underpants of society'. Or the always-amusing Rip Torn encouraging his team with the words: 'you're as useful as a cock-flavored lollipop'. The acting is great as it can be with Ben Stiller and Rip Torn who go delightfully over the top and lots of enthusiast cameos (Chuck Norris, David Hasselhof, William Shatner and even Lance Armstrong). It sure isn't Schindler's List but Dodgball is great entertainment and stress releasing.\",\n",
       " 'This film shows the best of the American cinema. Whether we like the film, or not, one has to recognize the greatest achievement, perhaps, of the creative talent of the people working in the movie industry. \"Gone with the Wind\" represents a monumental leap, as well as a departure, for the movies, as they were done prior to this film.The vision of David O. Selznick, the power behind bringing Margaret Mitchell\\'s massive account about the South, before and after the Civil War, pays handsomely with the film that Victor Fleming directed. This movie will live forever because it reminds us of how this great nation came into being, despite the different opinions from the two stubborn factions in the war.\"Gone with the Wind\" brought together the best people in Hollywood. The end result is the stunning film that for about four hours keep us interested in the story unfolding in the screen. Of course, credit must be due to the director, Victor Fleming, and his vision, as well as the adaptation by Sydney Howard, who gave the right tone to the film. The gorgeous cinematography created by Ernest Haller gives us a vision of the gentle South before the war, and the Phoenix raising from the ashes of a burned Atlanta. The music of Max Steiner puts the right touch behind all that is seen in the movie.One can\\'t conceive another Scarlett O\\'Hara played by no one, but Vivien Leigh. Her beauty, her sense of timing, her intelligent approach to this role, makes this a hallmark performance. Ms. Leigh was at the best moment of her distinguished career and it shows. Scarlett goes from riches to rags, back to riches again and in the process finds an inner strength she didn\\'t know she possessed. Her impossible love for Ashley will consume her and will keep her away from returning the love to the man that really loves her, Rhett.The same thing applies to the Rhett Butler of Clark Gable. No one else comes to mind for playing him with the passion he projects throughout the movie. This is a man\\'s man. Captain Butler was torn between his loyalty to the cause of the South and his sense of decency. His love for Scarlett, the woman he knows is in love with a dream, speaks eloquently for itself.The other two principals, Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard, give performances that are amazing to watch. Ms. de Havilland\\'s Melanie Hamilton is perfect. Melanie is loyal to the woman that does everything to undermine her marriage to Ashley. Mr. Howard\\'s Ashley gives a perfect balance to the man in love with his wife, while Scarlett keeps tempting him.The rest of the cast is too numerous to make justice to all the actors one sees on the screen, but omitting the contribution of Hattie McDaniel to the film would be sinful. Ms. McDaniel was such a natural actress that she is excellent no matter in what movie she is playing. This huge talent is a joy to watch.Comments to this forum express their objections to the way the race relations play in the movie, but being realistic, this movie speaks about the not too distant past where all kinds of atrocities, such as the slavery, were the norm of the land. While those things are repugnant to acknowledge, in the film, they are kept at a minimum. After all, this film is based on a book by one of the daughters of that South, Margaret Mitchell, who is presenting the story as she saw it in her mind, no doubt told to her from relatives that lived in that period of a horrible page in the American history.Enjoy this monumental classic in all its splendor.',\n",

I have not been to New York (it is a dream of mine to go there one day), but I imagine those who live there, will feel the mood and the general idea the movie gives us. This is New York of the 80s .. so yes a certain building is still standing strong - hopefully you do not have strong feelings about that. In a negative way that is.The animation is good - and while you have to suspend your disbelief (a dog living on his own, being humanized - same with other animals), all being called by the name of ... well the animal they are. So the dog has the name dog on his door bell. There is one funny moment, where he (or she, but I assume it is he) has a tag with the name cat ... just a small little joke ... and there are many others to be found all over the movie.Fore and background working hand in hand .. like our two main characters. Though you just know that things are way too perfect ... something has to give. And while that also requires a big amount of suspension of disbelief (there surely has to be another way to get ... \"there\"/inside/outside), it is important for the movie .. and the growth of the characters.

How on Earth did they think this would appeal?It's a lifeless watch, it rambles along at a torturous pace, and sadly half the cast seem totally disinterested, giving very wooden performances.Special effects vary, some look good, some look very poor, when you look at the budget this film had, it should have looked flawless, it doesn't.I love Gemma Chan and Richard Madden, but neither of them look totally at home here, I only hope this turkey of a movie doesn't halt either career.I don't think a second will follow somehow.Awful sadly, I did give it a second watch to be sure, but there you are, it's a shocker, 3/10.\",\n",
       " 'Having heard the endless amount of critique and insults that the last part of the Godfather saga carries.. I have to disagree. Although people seem to love to hate Sophie Coppola and say she ruined the film, I think her part alone wasn\\'t that frail it\\'d ruin the entire cinematic experience. Saying that is just humorous. Also, the absence of Tom Hagen played by Robert Duvall is really a loss and even I think this film would\\'ve been a lot better if there was him in it.. but he got too greedy and couldn\\'t make it into the movie, and that\\'s that. I\\'m not going to judge a movie by what it could have been, but what it is and how good it ends up being.Despite some shortcomings, Godfather Part 3 is a decent ending to the trilogy. While it may have been an attempt to cash off the audience, they still have Coppola bring us his finest directing. I found Al Pacino\\'s performance extremely satisfying and even terrifyingly so. He embodies the mistakes and losses of his life with excellent skill, showing us a don that has lost his health, the loved ones of his life and even the respect for himself. While I never found Diane Keaton\\'s performances in the saga that good, she still fills the spot required, same goes for Talia Shire, whose role in the ending finale of the film really came as a surprise to me - which was a good thing. I didn\\'t find her role in Part 2 too appealing but in this one she has more character, more importance. Sophie Coppola was OK, like I said a lot of people have complained about her acting skills and I gotta admit she was a little \"stiff\" or sorts in some scenes but it\\'s not notable all the time and it didn\\'t spoil any moods for me. Andy Carcia was just excellent, my favorite add to the saga cast, playing the son of his father with excellence.So, umm.. this film is perfectly fine. The ending finale was tremendously well shot and very climatic, filled with a lot of excitement. I\\'m telling you this movie is a great ending to the saga even because of that one particular scene so just go see it, despite what a lot of people have said about, badmouthing it for faulty reasons.. it brought a tear into my eye. It did.',\n",
       " 'Out of all the \"Oscar Bait\" films I\\'ve seen this year, this film beats them all. Little Children is an unbelievable masterpiece about what it means to grow up. This idea is brilliantly portrayed through characters - while categorized as \"adults\" - have yet to outgrow certain adolescent stages.Brad is a man who never got the chance to experience the spotlight in his youth, and now he desperately craves attention, acknowledgment, or admiration in any form.Sarah is a woman who never learned how to grow past her own selfishness. She is angry at her daughter for needing attention when all Sarah wants is some time to herself.Larry is a man who still harbors bully-like tendencies, and desperately just wants to fit in and be one of the guys. This is seen through his treatment of Ronnie - the pedophile who was just released from prison and returned to the neighborhood.Ronnie is the dangerous man. The man who cannot connect with people his own age and seeks sexual gratification with children or with people who - like him - cannot fit into the adult world.This isn\\'t an action moving - it\\'s an interaction movie. The scenes between characters have you nailed to your seat and deeply invested. The characters interact within their small community, and their actions with each other build into a climatic explosion that forces them all to face truths about themselves, and - finally - accept their responsibilities as mothers, husbands, fathers, and humans. This accepting is what separates little children from adults, immature from mature.The tale is moving, sad, hilarious, dark, breathtaking, thought-provoking and many other creative adjectives. It forces you to reevaluate your idea of yourself and your thoughts on others. It forces you to see people you would normally loath and dismiss in a differently light. This a movie you will come out of changed. If you only see one film a higher, I cannot recommend this one more.',\n",

Buried somewhere between the special effects (extraordinary by the way) is one the wittiest satires to come out of Hollywood in many, many moons. Meryl Streep is sensational and Bruce Willis is, I swear, unrecognizable in the best possible way. The movie hits the highest moments when, for instance, Meryl asks Isabella Rossellini how much the magic potion costs and Isabella replays: \"Oh the sordid topic of coin\" sublime, exquisite, funny but with enormous regard for its audience. But when Bruce calls Goldie Hawn to explain the \"incident\" at home he goes through a TV style monologue that seems to belong to a sit-com and not to the elegant vulgarity of this three sad, magnificent wannabees. The dialog, for the most part, is the best in any American serious comedy since Billy Wilder. The structure of the script is flawless and inventive. The costumes are atrocious and certain scenes seem directed by a 3rd assistant. I don\\'t know how to explain it. However, I have it, I own it and sometimes I put it on with my finger in the fast forward. What\\'s good is so good that makes the whole thing really worth it.',\n",
       " \"After viewing 'Rear Window' again, I've come to realize that Alfred Hitchcock was not only a great moviemaker but also a great moviewatcher. In the making of 'Rear Window,' he knew exactly what it is about movies that makes them so captivating. It is the illusion of voyeurism that holds our attention just as it held Hitchcock's. The ability to see without being seen has a spellbinding effect. Why else is it so uncommon to have characters in movies look directly into the camera? It just isn't as fun to watch someone when they know you're there. When we watch movies, we are participating in looking into another world and seeing the images of which we have no right to see and listening to the conversations that we should not hear. 'Rear Window' and Powell's 'Peeping Tom' are some of the best movies that aren't afraid to admit this human trait. We are all voyeurs.When watching 'Rear Window,' it is better to imagine Alfred Hitchcock sitting in that wheelchair rather than Jimmy Stewart. When the camera is using longshots to watch the neighborhood, it is really Hitchcock watching, not Stewart. Hitchcock's love of voyeurism is at the center of this movie, along with his fascination with crime and his adoration of the Madonna ideal.In many of Hitchcock's movies, 'Rear Window,' 'Vertigo,' 'Psycho,' 'The Birds,' etc, the blonde actresses are objects. Notice how rarely they get close with the male leads. In 'Vertigo,' Stewart's character falls in love with the image of Madeleine; in 'Psycho,' we see the voyeur in Hitchcock peeking out of Norman Bates at Marion; and in 'Rear Window,' Jeff would rather stare out of his window than to hold the beautiful Lisa by his side. For Hitchcock, these women are ideals that should be admired rather than touched.However, the story of 'Rear Window' isn't about the image of women, as it is in 'Vertigo.' 'Rear Window' focuses more on seduction of crime, not in committing it but in the act of discovering it. At one point in the story, Jeff's friend convinces him that there was no murder, and Jeff is disappointed, not because someone wasn't dead but because he could no longer indulge into his fantasy that someone was. Think how popular crime shows are on television, and noir films at the movies. People do not want to commit crimes; they want to see other people commit them.'Rear Window' is one of the most retrospective movies I've ever seen. In a span of two hours, it examines some of the most recurrent themes in film. When we watch 'Rear Window,' it is really us watching someone watch someone else. And all the while, Hitchcock is sitting on the balcony and seeing our reaction. It is an act of voyeurism layered on top of itself, and it allows us to examine our own behavior as we are spellbound in Hitchcock's world. The only thing that I feel is missing in the movie is a scene of Jeff using his binoculars and seeing himself in a mirror. Why did Hitchcock leave it out? Maybe because it would have been too obvious what he was doing. Or maybe he was afraid that the audience would see themselves in the reflection of the lens.\",\n",
       " \"Is amuses me how easily many here can offer condemnation of this film. If you condemn it by reason that it doesn't capture the viewer in a way that say The Maltese Falcon or Vertigo did then perhaps I can understand.It seems however that most of the harsh words are coming from the youngsters without much desire to even know what real films were like. I suppose it's not entirely their fault. I mean an action film to them has to involve no less than 55% CGI effects, 25% scantily clad, or outright nude actresses, oh! and more times than not a totally unrealistic plot. But you see many years back in the early 70s and beyond they didn't have CGI to make up for lacking plots and poor acting. And at that point and time you couldn't really show full nudity so you couldn't rack them into theaters that way either (note the first scene with the lovely Miss. Bissett where she emerges from the shower and barely flashes just the side of her breast. That was probably pretty racy for the time).So since you can't have any cheap outs like you can today, Gee Whiz! you had to have a real plot and have the ability to act! Lancaster has always been a favorite and he did act very well in this film. Youngsters see the likes of Dean Martin and George Kennedy and don't know what to think because all they've ever known was a Hollywood that produces computer generated fluff. Frankly guys if your idea of an action movie is watching Speed then you need to widen your horizon (no offense to the great Dennis Hopper).Airport was not as in depth as the book, this is true. Seldom will you find a screenplay to be written with the same depth. Do you know why? Because you can't make the film last for 9 hours!I know this is more a rebuttal that an outright review of the movie, but it amazes me how some of the CGI junkies have room to talk when it comes to offering their disdain for films with some of the most historic actors in history. This movie is totally entertaining and works well. And the idea some whine because it may not be 'PC' by today's standards is nothing more than extremist liberal drivel. Dino womanizing is apparently an offensive no-no. But today you can show something 50 times as bad and because its more modern and allegedly more acceptable by this standard, no one blinks.

       " 'When people talk about perfect films I don\\'t actually know what they mean. Perfect for whom? Perfect compared to what? I think that perfection is in the brain and heart of the beholder. \"Rosemary\\'s baby\" is a perfect film to me. Scary in a way that makes you breathless. You\\'re thinking and feeling throughout the film. One of the many sides of Polanski\\'s genius is to suggest. And what he suggest is so monstrous that we don\\'t want to believe it, but we do. The characters are so perfectly drawn that there is no cheating involved. John Cassavettes\\'s superb study in selfishness and egomaniacal frustration is so real that comes to no surprise that he could do what he does to advance his career, but we are surprised, we\\'re horrified. The spectacular Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer are not Deborah Kerr and David Niven, are they? So that they turn out to be what they turn out to be is totally believable, but Polanski presents it in such a light of normality that you can\\'t believe it. Mia Farrow\\'s predicament is as classic as the boy who cried wolf tale and yet, as told by Roman Polanski in the wonderful face of Mia Farrow, is as if we\\'re hearing it, seeing it and living it for the first time. Every silence, every voice in the distance, every door opening. Your heart is always in your throat. There is something there that accelerates a constant state of dread. Very few movies have been able to take me to that place, most of them by Roman Polanski, what about \"The Tenant\" or \"Repulsion\"? Other movies that come to mind: David Lynch\\'s \"Eraserhead\" and Martin Donovan\\'s \"Apartment Zero\" But \"Rosemary\\'s baby\" stands alone as a terrifying masterpiece.',\n",

Jane, Thelma and Louis, and Alien all ran for at least two hours or more, so big surprise there guys. In addition Scott didn\\'t set out to film another scarface, he set out to tell a story not just about Frank Lucas but rather a tale of corruption and how pervasive it is. One user commented that this film had many side story lines that \"bloated\" the story. This is completely untrue as every \"side story\" is actually the overarching story about the fight against corruption in every facet of life, even Frank Lucas attempts several times to eradicate the corruption in his organization.Over all this is a great film which really gets into every nook and cranny of an issue. Don\\'t see this film if your just looking for cheap thrills, this is a thinking film about the pervasive dishonesty of our culture.I gave this film 8 stars because i could find nothing solid that detracted from it, but rather a slew of minor details which gradually brought its score down.

       " 'While many people agree that the Sound of Music is one of the best films of all time, some are at a loss to adequately explain why; they buckle under and admit that there are parts that are syrupy, etc. Well, I\\'ll tell you why it\\'s the best movie ever (and I DON\\'T agree that it\\'s too syrupy). It simply has everything one could want in a movie. First of all, it has a REAL romance - one where you can watch the characters slowly fall in love. It\\'s not like today\\'s movies where two characters meet and the next scene is them waking up together. Secondly, it has humor. Not syrupy or corny humor, but very wry, dry tongue-in-cheek humor. For evidence, look at the quotes. Baronness Schraeder is especially well-done in this regard. Her comments simply drip with ice. \"Good bye, Maria. I\\'m sure you\\'ll make a fine nun.\"  You want to smack her. Thirdly, it\\'s got adventure. The Nazis are the ultimate villains in any movie - WWII was as clear a case of good vs. evil as you can find, making it great fodder for films - and so it\\'s great to see Maria, the Captain and the kids outwit them. Fourthly, it\\'s got great music. Fifthy, it\\'s got great scenery. And the plot and dialogue are astounding. I find new things to admire each time I watch. Finally, is there a greater scene in any movie than the nuns revealing the stolen Nazi car parts??? \"The Sound of Music\" does not just succeed because it cheers people up with syrup or song.  It succeeds because it is a wonderfully-constructed, wonderfully-written, wonderfully-acted, brilliant movie.  For me, no other movie can compare.  Not to be obsessed with it or anything. :)',\n",

       " 'I have grown extremely tired of the typical formula spy film like Bond, or the juvenile stunt exhibition \"Triple X.\" There have been a bare handful of spy films that feature relatively realistic spy thrillers, especially recently with a concentration on spectacular movies that have less substance than cotton candy.Besides \"The Bourne Identity,\" \"Ronin\" is the only other recent spy movie I can think of that didn\\'t feature skydiving, bungie jumping, skiing downhill while shooting innumerable bad guys, laser pens, cars with ejection seats, or silicone breasted women with names you\\'d be vaguely embarrassed to say in front of your mother. Most of the crap that passes for an espionage film has no plot or reason for existing other than to meet a quota of explosions and cleavage in order to draw the summer action film crowd.While \"Bourne\" does not have a particularly deep plot, it is consistent and focused. The focus is entirely upon Bourne and how he is to deal with having no memory of his past, being hunted without knowing why. Some people have complained about being confused by the movie. I for one, do not need to have everything spelled out since in many cases this smacks of unreality in the first place; the essence of espionage is drawing conclusions from very sketchy information. If you can\\'t handle a little of that, you probably should stick to Disney films or TV\\'s Scooby Doo where everything is explained in the end. We never find out about what is in the case in \"Ronin\" and I can live without some information being filled in about Bourne\\'s past.To those who have moaned about the incompatibility of the book and the movie, seek help. There are probably several things that work in the book that would either be boring and take too much screen time to explain, or would be viewed as cliche to modern screen audiences. As I remember, I liked the book, and I definitely like this movie. I view any movie adaptation as an interpretation of the book rather than a translation from words to pictures anyway.As for realism, most of the action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets are to be seen, no incredibly lovely models fall madly in bed with Bourne, and the hero shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competance. As someone who has trained in martial arts for over 10 years, unrealistic fight scenes are a pet peeve. The fights in \"Bourne\" are fast, nasty, and very realistic while still being entertaining for the layman. (And yes, taking a gun away from some idiot who is standing well within your striking radius without getting shot is definitely doable, though I had serious doubts until we tested it for ourselves with plastic dart guns in the dojo several years ago).While not being perfect, \"The Bourne Identity\" is, simply put, several grades above the typical spy film. Being focused on an individual level rather than involving itself huge political ramifications lends it another layer of respectability rather than detracting from it as some comments have implied since it remains a human problem on a comprehensible scale. The mysteries that are left are bigger mysteries for Bourne than us, and I think should be viewed as intentional omissions rather than loose ends. The implausibilities are kept to a minimum and the realism to as high a level as possible while still being spectacular enough to meet the expectations of the genre.',\n",

       " 'Saw JACK REACHER on Monday night at an advance screening. Here\\'s some of my thoughts. There are no spoilers.First off, I\\'d say I agree with the general critical reception: 4/5 stars. To me that means it\\'s a solid movie that delivers at the high end of its genre. JACK REACHER isn\\'t trying to be anything revolutionary, it\\'s more the kind of action thriller audiences haven\\'t seen for a while.This isn\\'t MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE or even James Bond. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie takes his inspiration from action movies of the late 60s/early 70s like DIRTY HARRY (which has been name checked in a couple reviews already), BULLITT (for the car chase); and maybe another Don Siegel movie, CHARLEY VARRICK. The excitement here doesn\\'t come from over the top stunts or huge explosions. Like the action movies just referenced, you thrill to watching a strongly defined protagonist outsmart, outfight and outmaneuver the bad guys.Which brings me to the character of Jack Reacher and the casting of Tom Cruise. In the series of novels by Lee Child this movie is based on, Jack Reacher is an ex-MP detective. After a lifetime spent on military bases overseas, he lives as a drifter in the United States who adheres to a life of zero commitments: No house, no job, no car, no possessions, no family. Oh, and he stands 6\\'5\" and weighs 250 lbs.Clearly Tom Cruise doesn\\'t match that physical description. What makes Reacher such a great character in Child\\'s books though has far less to do with his exterior than it does with his intellect. If you\\'ve read the series as I have, it\\'s a little strange at first. As the film played out however, I got more relaxed and more into it. This was definitely a movie about Lee Child\\'s hero Jack Reacher, physical differences be damned.Would I have preferred an unknown actor closer to Child\\'s description to play Reacher on screen? Yes, of course. But I could say that about virtually any character, and often do. I generally want unknowns for everything.Which is where Cruise\\'s casting comes in handy a bit. Because his casting sort of guarantees a certain amount of box office, it means the filmmakers can take more chances. Like crafting an action movie that\\'s longer on character and occasional brutal violence and short on mindless action and impossible nonsense.JACK REACHER was a very satisfying action thriller for me. I felt it captured what I love about Lee Child\\'s thrillers and Jack Reacher in particular. I\\'d definitely recommend it, and I\\'m going to see it in the theater again. That\\'s for damn sure.',\n",
       " \"In a style reminiscent of the best of David Lean, this romantic love story sweeps across the screen with epic proportions equal to the vast desert regions against which it is set.  It's a film which purports that one does not choose love, but rather that it's love that does the choosing, regardless of who, where or when; and furthermore, that it's a matter of the heart often contingent upon prevailing conditions and circumstances.  And thus is the situation in `The English Patient,' directed by Anthony Minghella, the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most inopportune of places and times, proving that when it is predestined, love will find a way.It's WWII; flying above the African desert, Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) is shot down, his biplane mistaken for an enemy aircraft. And though he survives the crash, he is severely burned.  To his great good fortune, however, he is rescued by a tribe of nomads and winds up in a hospital.  But existing conditions are governed by circumstances of war, and Almasy soon becomes one of many patients being transported via convoy to a different facility.  Upon reaching Italy, he is too weak and ill to continue on, and a Canadian nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), volunteers to stay behind with him at an abandoned monastery.Hana soon discovers that her charge is something of a man of mystery, as Almasy remembers nothing of his past, and not even his own name.  Thought to be English, the only clues pointing to who he is are contained in a book found in his possession after the crash, but even they are as cryptic as Hana's patient.  Slowly, however, under prompting from Hana, Almasy begins to remember bits and pieces of his life, and his story begins to unfold. And his memory is helped along even more by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who suspects that Almasy is the man he's been looking for-- a man with whom he wants to settle a score. But, burned beyond recognition, Almasy may or may not be that man. Meanwhile, Almasy's memories continue to surface; memories of a woman he loved, Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas)-- as well as memories of Katherine's husband, Geoffrey (Colin Firth).  And, crippled in mind and body as he is, those memories become the only thing left to which he can cling with any hope at all, even as his life seems to be slipping farther away with each passing moment.In addition to directing, Anthony Minghella also wrote the screenplay for this film, which he adapted from the novel by Michael Ondaatje.  The result is an epic saga presented in the tradition of Lean's `Doctor Zhivago' and `Lawrence of Arabia'; a magnificent film that fills the screen and the senses with unprecedented grandeur and beauty.  Simply put, Minghella's film is genius realized; crafted and delivered with a poetic perfection, watching it is like watching a Monet come to life.  From the opening frames, Minghella casts a hypnotic spell over his audience that is binding and transporting, with a story that has an emotional beauty that equals the engagingly stunning and vibrant images brought to life by John Seale's remarkable cinematography; images that virtually fill the screen as well as the soul of the viewer.  In every sense, this is a film of rare eloquence, with a striking emotional capacity that facilitates an experience that is truly transcendental.  Nominated in twelve categories, it deservedly received a total of nine Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actress (Binoche) and Cinematography.If one had to choose a single word to describe the `essence' of this film, it would be `excellence.'  Even an extraordinary film, however, does not receive nine Oscars without performances that are extraordinary in kind; and the performances given by Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas here transcend the term `Oscar worthy.'  Nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Almasy (Geoffrey Rush was awarded the gold for `Shine'), Fiennes has never been better, achieving an emotional depth with his character that is nearly palpable.  Private and introspective, Almasy is not by his very nature an individual to whom the audience will be able to form an intimate connection; Fiennes, however, finds a way to open that emotional door just enough to let you in, enough so that you taste the honest passion welling up within him.  And it works.  Almasy does not seek your friendship; he will, however, gain your compassion.Kristen Scott Thomas, too, received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (Frances McDormand received the award for `Fargo') for her portrayal of Katherine, a woman whose stoic countenance masks the emotional conflict raging within her, born of the forbidden passion that enslaves her and yet to which she gives herself willingly, casting off her shackles of repression to embrace a love so strong it threatens to consume her.  The reserve Katherine must maintain evokes the empathy of the audience, as Scott Thomas successfully mines the emotional depths of her character to the greatest possible effect.  It's the kind of performance that draws you in and holds you fast, taking you as it does beyond that curtain of hypocrisy that dictates what must be if only for the sake of appearances, and allows you to experience a true sense of unbridled passion.  Understated and shaded with subtlety, it's terrific work by Kristin Scott Thomas.Binoche gives a stunning, affecting performance, as well, as the kindhearted nurse, Hana; it is her humanity, in fact, which defines love in it's purest sense and offers a balanced perspective of it within the context of the film.  Her relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) affords us a glimpse of passion of another kind, which contrasts effectively with the intensity of that between Almasy and Katherine.  `The English Patient' is a film that will move you and fill you emotionally; one you will not want to see end. 10/10.\",\n",
       " \"What a wonderful and unusual experience, to see a film without knowing anything about it. Before I knew it I was in Yorkshire. The silence was deafening, emotions unspoken. Then, Josh O'Connor - a miraculous actor - I didn't know who the actor was and that helped enormously to get sucked into his world - exterior and interior - and to live his experience fully. Alec Secareanu produces the perfect emotional blow. Roughness and tenderness in a stunning, totally believable performance that, I know will live in my mind forever. They changed me somehow. I was forced to look at something in a different way, without preconceptions. Gemma Jones and Ian Hart. complete this masterpiece that I intend to see again tonight with a group of friends who, like me, don't know the first thing about the film, other that I loved it. Francis Lee I'm joining the chorus with a heartfelt, thank you.\",\n",

       " \"The movie quality is fine, some transitions were a bit clunky leaving you wondering how you got to that point, but it was overall well done technically. It was a better romance than it was a horror but, that's not what it billed itself as nor any I went, so that was annoying. Then if course because it's 2022 they made sure the main character and her friend frequently made racist comments about white people. This plus the entitled and arrogant millennial attitude left the main character unlikable. There were no real reaming qualities to make up for this mess.Rent twilight, watch Hallmark and chat with a college student instead. Will save you money and give you the gist.\",\n",
       " 'I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! After seeing sneak peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so-so 6/10) I enjoyed this a lot more! As seen in the trailer, one knock I had was believing that a whole town could be \"forgotten\" but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so I accept it for what it is.My only major complaint is I assumed Paris Hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc. and moan \"that\\'s hot\" but they didn\\'t do that (how could they resist???).There is NO nudity from the 2 girls although Paris looks great in her lingerie! I\\'m surprised they didn\\'t put a 3rd \"hot token victim\" in the movie for some needless nudity which is the norm for this type of flick! I won\\'t list any death or plot spoilers BUT I will say that Paris & Eliza both get roughed up good! The characters are developed decently and are somewhat likable (not like Cabin Fever where you wanted them to die) and the movie has a decent pace although nothing happens in the 1st 30 minutes like most horror films.I give it a 8/10 as it delivered good scares and gore and I had low expectations going into it. If you go with some friends that like cheesy horror movies you\\'ll have a good time.Noah',\n",
       " \"Just saw at this an advanced screening in Huntington Beach. It was pretty damn good. I do have to admit that I am an Adam Sandler fan. Being 21, I grew up seeing his films in theaters and for the most part liked them all. I think with Big Daddy, Dennis Dugan and Adam Sandler's Happy Madison crew really started a formula of movie. Central conflicted and imperfect character Adam (who has a good heart of course), falls in love with the girl of his dreams, who is younger and way better looking than him, all formulated around a specific central premise (i.e. with this film it's Adam's lies piling on top of lies) supported by extremely strong, quirky side character performances. This might be the epitome of this established formula, really passing 50 First Dates in my opinion. The typical Sandler ridiculous humor and smart-ass remarks are extremely well balanced with perfectly timed and executed emotional moments. The set-up for the story is pretty basic and at first almost appears predictable. It is to some extent, but the crazy directions the movie takes based on Sandler's lies is well done and only stretches a few times. But what do you expect from the Happy Madison crew? The 2 kids in the film did a good job and had some funny lines. I am not a Jennifer Aniston fan at all but really actually liked her in this. I sort of understand her popularity and charm after this movie. She seemed more genuine and I felt an emotional attachment to her that I have always lacked with her. Plus, she is showcased in a particular waterfall scene and looks absolutely fantastic in a bikini. Brooklyn Decker is unbelievably gorgeous, as we all know from the SI Swimsuit Edition, but I was very surprised at how natural of an actress she was. She seemed very comfortable and didn't overact much. She is extremely cute and lovable. Nicole Kidman and Dave Mathews were great as an uber cool couple. Nicole was a bit over the top as she has been of late (like since Moulin Rouge), but thats what her character called for so I understand. Dave was surprisingly good as an almost drugged up yuppie, cool boyfriend of Nicole's. Nick Swardson was absolutely hilarious and by far steals every scene he is in. He really comes into the movie about 1/3 of the way in and from there on out its his movie. Nick Swardson deserves fame for this.I can't say for sure how the critics will receive it. I can handle suspension of disbelief as long as it leads to a funny payoff. For the most part these moments are delivered. It's a great date movie and a great movie for Sandler fans. He has an unbelievable recent track record for success, but this will top all of them at the box office.\",\n",
       " \"'Home Alone' has succeeded in establishing itself as a Christmas tradition, spawning off three sequels (including a made-for-television flop), and a whole franchise in and of it.Macaulay Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, the average American child. He has an attitude almost expected of a Chris Columbus film from the eighties. He lives with a large family, which, right now, being around Christmas time, is about quadrupled, flooded by relatives' children, all of whom pick on poor, poor Kevin (sympathy long lost later into the film).One day Kevin wakes up from his sleep to find his wish has come true: his parents (John Heard and Catherine O'Hara) have disappeared. Enthralled by this, he proceeds to do everything and anything he was not allowed to do before, including eating ice cream in the morning, watching violent gangster films, jumping on the bed, wrecking his brother's room, and having some fun with a BB gun. Unfortunately for Kevin, his parents have not just disappeared - they have accidentally left him at home before going to Paris!Trouble really starts when two pesky burglars, Harry Lime (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), decide that their next burglary will be at the McCallister residence. Little do they know Kevin is more than prepared, arming the house with an array of booby-traps that would impress top spies in the American government.John Hughes, writer/director/producer of my favorite comedy, 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles,' wrote this film, and it is no wonder. It is just like Hughes' humor. It mixes emotion, belly laughs and a warm-hearted ending all into one little bundle called a movie. John Hughes' films, in my experience, are usually very good, mainly because he approaches films at a very classic level. He doesn't resort to crude, kid jokes, like 'The Master of Disguise' or 'The Tuxedo,' to name a few recent flops. He almost always levels everything out perfectly in his scripts, and nothing is different here. Also, he places Kevin and co. in a large brick home in a large neighborhood in Chicago; a home that very much resembles those in 'Planes.' and 'Uncle Buck' (I would not be surprised if it is the same home).As for the acting.Macaulay Culkin is not at his best here. His best performance would have to be in an earlier John Hughes film named 'Uncle Buck,' where he had more of a cute charm than an acting charm. Here, he could barely act his way out of a plastic bag. Fortunately, with great performances by John Heard, Catherine O'Hara, Pesci and Stern, his bad acting is long forgotten by the time we become absorbed into the film.John Heard and Catherine O'Hara bring Kevin's parents to life. They seem almost complete opposites. Kevin's father, Peter (Heard), is very calm and laidback. His mother, Kate (O'Hara) is extremely nervous almost all the time, fretting throughout the film. She is aggravated very easily and, like all mothers, her instinctive nature to care for her child is what drives her to the point she goes to in the film.And then there's Pesci and Stern. My favorite lot of the film. They perfectly blend humor, pain and aggravation to the film.Pesci's character Harry is very strict, easily agitated and picks on Marv for a great many things. Marv, the stereotypical 'tall, stupid one,' is completely stupid. He does things that would make a hamster blush. Yet he is the character I have found many like the most, mainly because he is so stupid you have to feel sorry for him. Stern brings a great trait to the character of Marv, and I am very pleased he got the part. It's a hard choice to decide which baddie is better, so I just say I like them both the same.All in all, 'Home Alone' is probably the best Christmas movie to rise out of the film industry in the last twenty years. It seamlessly blends humor, pain, emotion, human instinct and some great booby-traps all into one little bundle. This film has stood the test of time greatly.4.5/5 stars -\",\n",
       " \"I liked Bitch because the story unfolds from such a simple premise: When it all gets too much for a mother of four, she takes herself out of the equation. We don't know whether she is making a conscious choice or suffering from a rare disease of the mind. All we know is that her workaholic husband now has to do without her. It doesn't go well, at least not initially. Bitch is not the world's deepest movie, but it's an entertaining lesson about the effort it takes to keep a family together.\",\n",
       " 'Whenever I see so much \"Oscar worthy\" tags/blurbs in an ad campaign I get nervous, see Cinderella Man. Usually you look closely at the fine print and see that the esteemed critic lauding the film is Joe Schmoe from the One Stop Light Bugle Press in Buttcreek, Illinois or a low level flunky who just happens to work for the media conglomerate that is distributing the film. So my heart sank a little when a film I have been eagerly awaiting was swaddled with such praise when the ads hit the air.But they\\'re right for once.Joaquin Phoenix wears Johnny Cash like a suit. He isn\\'t doing a Rich Little impersonation, you don\\'t rub your eyes in disbelief, but he channels a man so distinct in appearance and voice to a level that is beyond admirable. One of the traits that made Johnny Cash a legend was that nobody sounded or looked like him. Short of a computer generated Cash walking around in his own bio-pic like one of those John Wayne beer commercials this is the definitive representation.And yet Phoenix may not give the best performance in the film.Reese Witherspoon more than holds up her end in a role that easily could have been reduced to a clichéd bumpkin. Witherspoon portrays the on-stage June in the way June portrayed her own \"character\", the stage persona that people adored, while giving her the resolve and inner strength to be the woman who tamed a hell-bent, grizzly bear of a man like John.The chemistry of Phoenix and Witherspoon together in any scene, but their on-stage duets in particular, are truthful in a way that resonates long after the credits. I know that unless you have been living in a cave for the past week you have likely been bombarded with the word that the actors sing themselves without use of lip syncing. I have never been a fan of musicals, or even musical performances in a film. They generally seem forced and uncomfortable to me, the moment when I stop experiencing the story and feel reminded that I am watching a movie. I never felt that in this film. I never felt that their singing took the focus of the film, but the performances work with the story like no other music bio I have ever seen. I never felt as if I was being led through the catalog, the songs felt as organic and natural as any spoken dialog in a great narrative.This film far exceeded my expectations and afforded me the first trip home from a theater with a true feeling of satisfaction in a very, very long time. Highly recommended.',\n",
       " \"I, personally, cannot understand why so many people have left negative comments about this film. When it was released, many of us were young children and we all enjoyed it, but now that we are older, too many people are pointing out the bad jokes and mistakes and clichés that they have found. The point is, this is a children's film, and we didn't see those mistakes when we were children because it's designed that way. Even so, people fail to see deeper into certain aspects of the film. Peter Pan was meant to be 'the boy who never grew up', so to have a tale of his adult life and to show how he forgot Neverland is a special and unique take on the story, one that won't be forgotten.There have also been many complaints about the scene where Tink becomes human-size and expresses some kind of love for Peter. Although she is not a human per se, she can have human feelings, so why would she not love him? As the original story tells, she is often jealous of other womens' affections towards him, and this film just extrapolates on that theme a little.There have been comments about the 'father-who-is-so-busy-and-can't-go-to-the-game' cliché. Well, here's news for you. It's cliché because it happens all the time, and it's a truth! Some parents are just too busy to care. Lastly, too many people are moaning that Hook was too comical to be the bad guy. Well, this is a kids film and if he wasn't a little bit cheery-in-a-maniac sort of way, you'd have parents complaining that their kids were scared.The main thing about this film is that it is really good, but it IS designed for children, and adults who go back and watch it years later, then suddenly spot loads of mistakes are just ruining it for themselves and others.\",\n",
       " 'Ben Kingsley\\'s portrayal of gangster Don Logan is destined to go down as one of the most memorable mobsters in filmdom; up there with the best from Robinson, Bogart, Cagney, Raft, deNiro, Pacino et al. Kingsley\\'s all that good and more.  And the other actors, in their portrayals of fellow gangsters and their lovers, are also excellent.  The story is simple. Gal (Ray Winstone) is a retired English gangster living a life of leisure at his Spanish villa. Then one day his idyll is shattered by a visit from Don Logan, an old protégé, and man to be feared. Logan\\'s intent is to lure Gal out of retirement for \\'one last job\\'. Gal wants nothing to do with it, and the first half of the movie is a battle of wits between the two men. The second half of the film deals with the heist and its aftermath.  The crime is downplayed in the movie which is primarily a psychological exploration of these gangsters; their personal demons, and the relationships amongst themselves. They are indeed scary people, no sympathetic characters here.\\nThis is one of the best movies of 2000, and is highly recommended. I don\\'t understand how IMDb reviewers can rate this movie so low. In my book it definitely rates an \"A\".',\n",
       " \"If there is a soul, it is made from the love we share. There are many ways to describe Oblivion, but the softly spoken afterword by Tom Cruise's character really makes you feel the human heartbeat of this sci-fi epic. As always, the trailer is full of explosions and set pieces. Oblivion the movie is an entirely different beast that values a human story and characters that are driven by common purpose. While the cast is tiny, I found much to enjoy from Cruise, Riseborough, Freeman and that Nordic guy from Headhunters who is showing up more frequently in Hollywood blockbusters. Aside from unusually limited screen-time, Morgan and other supporting cast are effective and memorable. The threads of the plot are well-woven and I won't give anything away, so what I will tell you is to prepare for a powerful journey into the unknown where nothing is what it seems. Explosive set pieces take a backseat for sci-fi philosophy with twists to spare. Oblivion ticks all the boxes for correct use of literary devices and establishes enough original cannon to stick in your mind long after the credits start rolling. It is a distinct success among the largely abysmal offerings of 2013 so far, don't miss it.\",\n",
       " 'Right off the bat the best part of this movie is the acting: Teller and Hill have great chemistry on screen. Jonah does a particularly good job at playing the \"guy you love to hate\". I can\\'t attest to the faithfulness of their portrayal of the real life people since I don\\'t know anything about them. The rest of the cast does a great job as well.The marketing for this movie was, unfortunately, deceitful: the trailer made it out to be this upbeat, funny, over the top comedy - which it\\'s not. In reality the movie has a much slower pace, not a lot of situational humor and is certainly not filled with hilarious quips (the bulk of which are in the trailer). This is not to say that the movie was bad or not at all funny, it just wasn\\'t what I expected (and I am sure I\\'m not alone).My final critique will go unnoticed for the majority of viewers but I found it personally offensive so I have to report it: some of the movie takes place in Albania, only the set for Albania is actually Romania. Which is fine, I understand that they probably did this for practical reasons and as a Romanian movie goer I just have to accept it (we all recognized it immediately though). However, at some point in the movie an \"Albanian\" woman says something, only she says it in Romanian. This may not seem like much but it totally took me out of the movie and ruined the experience for me. I find it completely unacceptable that they could not hire an Albanian to say those few lines. The two languages might seem interchangeable to the rest of the world, I am sure, but that was very much NOT the case for me and everyone else in the theater.I am a paying movie goer as well and I expect to be just as entertained as everyone else. This is, of course, not the first time that I\\'ve seen this in a film. But when a producer does something like this it shows me that they don\\'t respect their movie, so they can\\'t expect me to.My rating, however, is not based on this final bit of criticism. I gave it a 7/10 for slow pacing and lack of humor, which is the opposite of what I expected.I\\'d still recommend it, just don\\'t expect to be blown away.After watching it for a second time I decided to change my original rating from 7/10 to 8/10, mainly because the acting is just great and I respect the fact that the movie made me think about it and made me want to see it again.',\n",

       " 'Dealing with the aftermath of a tragedy turns a once warm and ebullient family man into a solemn, withdrawn, and angry loner in Kenneth Lonergan\\'s (\"Margaret\") bittersweet drama Manchester by the Sea, one of the best films of 2016. Set in the picturesque city of Manchester on Massachusetts\\' north shore, cinematographer Jody Lee Lipes (\"Martha Marcy May Marlene\") captures the rugged beauty of the New England town with its bays filled with trawlers and its winter streets and municipal buildings covered in a shimmering white. It is a town that looks as if it has not changed in decades, or even centuries.Lee Chandler, in a haunting performance by Casey Affleck (\"Interstellar\"), is a janitor/handyman who spends his days painting, doing minor plumbing work, repairing leaks, and so on or just giving advice while making sure to avoid any social interaction with the people he is working for. His nights are spent drinking alone in bars where he is quick to start fights or at home watching TV in his small apartment. There is no hint during the film\\'s first half hour about what has brought him to his present state of disequilibrium, but in his mumbling inability to express his thoughts, we know that something unspoken is driving his need for isolation.Lee has been living in nearby Quincy but, when his older brother, Joe (Kyle Chandler, \"Carol\") succumbs to a heart attack, he has to return to Manchester to make funeral arrangements and attend the reading of the will and to confront the people that he has turned away from. His grief over his brother\\'s death turns to shock, however, when he discovers that he has been named the legal guardian of Joe\\'s 16-year-old son Patrick (Lucas Hedges, \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\"), a popular high school student. Since Patrick\\'s mom Elise (Gretchen Mol, \"Anesthesia\") is an alcoholic who left town long ago, Lee is the only person who can assume the task.It is one, however, that he does not feel ready for. Eventually, the seminal event that changed Lee\\'s life forever is revealed, depicted in a straightforward manner without histrionics or pandering, even if the overused baroque music tends to amplify the drama beyond what is required. In flashback, we see that Lee was once a happy family man with a loving wife Randi (Michelle Williams, \"Suite Française\") and three young children and we see him joking around with his young nephew Patrick (Ben O\\'Brien) on their fishing boat. Assuming the responsibility of being a father-figure to Patrick, we glimpse the man that Lee used to be.The dialogue between the abrasive Lee and the feisty, sharp-tongued Patrick feels real and without guile but channeling the chemistry they have together into rebuilding his life is a challenge. Manchester by the Sea is a serious film but is balanced by humor. In one such scene, Patrick awkwardly attempts to hide the obvious from his mom about studying in his room with his girlfriend. Another funny incident takes place when Lee is used as a cover for Patrick\\'s surreptitious juggling of his two girlfriends. The issues between them take a more serious tone, however, when Lee is convinced that he and Patrick should move to Boston, a suggestion that Patrick rebels at, citing his high school girlfriends, his being on the soccer team, and his playing in the school band.Though Michelle Williams has a small role, she turns in one of her best performances. In a powerful confrontation with Lee, it is clear that she still loves him but has felt compelled to suppress it in order to bury the past and move on. Manchester by the Sea belongs to Casey Affleck, however, who turns in what is arguably the best performance of his career. The film does not have the sort of neat resolution that you may have come to expect but what it does have are real people whose lives you want to be a part of and you know that that world is not one that can only happen in the movies, but a real experience of life fully lived in all its pain and all its joy.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ll be honest, when I went into to cinema to watch this movie I was expecting to not like it. I had seen a little bit of the trailer and it did not really \"speak\" to me and Alita\\'s eyes were off putting. When the movie had begun I was actually searching for things to dislike but surprisingly there were none apart from a few cringeworthy moments. I quickly got used to Alita\\'s eyes and they became in fact likeable. The story began to draw me in and I got completely absorbed into the story and the visuals.The world is extraordinary and beautiful and the action scenes in this movie are fantastic, quite honestly some of the best I have seen. The story is a bit fast paced but not to a degree that it feels rushed. Alita as a character is great, she is kind-hearted, innocent, naive and protective. Throughout the movie Alita grows as a person and learns about sacrifice, loss, love and the horrors of the human mind. Alita is very likeable because she is such a good person in such a horrible world and you can\\'t help feeling very sympathetic for an innocent being like her as she is exposed to the cruel world of Iron City.I watched this movie without knowing the source material and I loved it. I was drawn in very early on and had to watch it a second time. I can definitely recommend this movie to anyone.',\n",
       " 'If I didn\\'t know it was based on a \"true\" story I might have dismissed this movie as \"unrealistic\", particularly in the first half hour or so when it started off like another Julia Roberts comedy. At the beginning the film appears to focus primarily on her wardrobe, her foul language, and the developing romance with the \"boy next door\", whom she initially dislikes. As it turns out, the actual story, according to the bonus features on the DVD was even more melodramatic than the film\\'s. The real Erin actually got sick to the point of hospitalization from the chromium in Hinkley. The director wisely decided to cut out this part of the story, to avoid making her too much of a martyr. Another aspect while not totally ignored (she does mention at least once that she\\'s a \"slow reader\") but underplayed is Erin\\'s dyslexia. This makes her accomplishments all the more amazing! Personally, I think this fact could have been emphasized more, as no doubt it was a big factor behind her \"attitude\" problems - her combativeness toward people with more education than herself, her struggles in finding a job, perhaps even in her efforts to accentuate her physical attractiveness through her outrageous clothing. All in all I found it an enjoyable and enlightening story - the triumph of a unique individual whose determination, empathy, and sense of moral duty ultimately outweigh her abrasiveness and lack of social graces. And largely why she triumphs is her partnership with an intelligent and decent lawyer in Ed Masry. What a refreshing departure from the usual Hollywood stereotype! On many occasions, he effectively counters Erin\\'s prejudices with rational explanations how and why the legal system works the way it does, and why lawyers behave the way they do. With her passion and his reason, they make a great team. Now if only the movie hadn\\'t fallen into the old Hollywood trap of giving its leading lady more outfits than is realistic for someone of her economic status. The point that Erin dressed provocatively and this caused problems with her co-workers could have easily been made with just 3 or 4 costumes. Other than that, it was a good movie - great performances and a wonderful story.',\n",

But Josh attends college in upstate New York, while Tiffany has gone to school in Texas. Josh's friends think he's crazy to keep up a long-distance relationship when there are plenty of girls around to . . . date. Particularly alluring is Beth (Amy Smart), who has the hots for Josh. When Josh is unable to locate Tiffany by phone and begins to suspect that she's been cheating on him, he gives in to his urges and brings Beth back to his dorm room for a night of hot love. Beth, eager to show how wild she can be, decides to videotape the encounter. The next day, Josh finds out that he couldn't reach Tiffany because of a family emergency, and is immediately wracked with guilt. Things get more complicated when his knuckleheaded suitemate Barry mistakes the sex tape for a video message to Tiffany which Josh had asked him to drop in the mail. Horrified at the thought of Tiffany popping a tape into the VCR to see him making the double-backed beast with another girl, Josh determines to travel to Texas to intercept the illicit tape. His two best friends--resident prankster E.L. (Sean W. Scott) and stoner-intellectual Rubin (Paul Costanzo)--offer to come along, and help Josh persuade mega-nerd Kyle (D.J.

From that point on, 'Road Trip' follows the traditional teen exploitation comedy format, though with greater wit and intelligence than should be expected from the genre. Director Todd Phillips manages to give us slapstick, gross-out comedy while simultaneously poking fun at stereotypes and experiences familiar to anyone who's gone to college (psycho-sorority hazing, TAs trying to make undergrad girls, alcohol- and pot-related shenanigans, the nerd breaking bad, a hilarious run-in at an all-black fraternity house,etc.). Compensating for the adolescent hijinks is the surprisingly smart and thoughtful subplot for Kyle, who transforms from nerdy object of derision into the film's most likable and memorable character.In the tradition of 'Animal House,' 'Road Trip' is crass and juvenile, but irresistibly funny. Not a movie for date night, but a good choice for gathering around the tube with bongs, brews, and bros. An instant joe six-pack classic.\",\n",
       " 'A shape shifting young man (Brian Krause) and his mother (known as \"sleepwalkers\" for some reason) arrive in a new town. But the mother (Alice Krige) needs to feed, so her son Charles must find him a pure young woman. But who will he love more, his mother or the beautiful Tanya Robertson (Madchen Amick)? \"Sleepwalkers\" is a film that has a special place in my heart. I saw it repeatedly on television as a teenager watching our local horror host, Ned the Dead. And while I never thought it was great, I found it entertaining. I place it in the same category as \"Maximum Overdrive\" -- cheesy and fun, though by no means a great film. And look at the cameos in this film! Mike Mayo tears this film apart, calling it \"arguably King\\'s worst film\". He says the \"script meanders through pointless chitchat scenes.\" Director Mick Garris \"doesn\\'t know how to photograph\" and throws in \"close-ups of knees.\" Wow. He has nothing nice to say about this film, giving it a dismal 0 on his one through four scale. I must beg to differ with Mike on this one.First of all, King\\'s worst film is \"Langoliers\". Second, I did not notice these pointless chitchat scenes he speaks of. Some of the plot is a bit loose, but nothing is completely pointless. I furthermore do not recall any shots of knees, though if the knees belonged to the beautiful Madchen Amick I think this is forgivable. Mick Garris has made many a bad film, this is true. And \"Sleepwalkers\" is by no means a masterpiece. But I think to lay down such heavy scorn is misplaced and really ignores the \"fun factor\" of this picture.Oddly enough, Howard Maxford, whom I almost never agree with, seems to get this one. He calls the film \"silly but quite lively\" and points out the \"nifty effects\" and \"gag cameos\" (Stephen King, Clive Barker, Joe Dante, Tobe Hooper and John Landis). And there you go -- recognition of the fun this film was and still is.Ron Perlman (\"Hellboy\", \"Pro-Life\") plays a cop and doesn\\'t get nearly enough screen time. Not sure what else to say about that. Clearly they did not foresee the star power in Perlman.',\n",
       " 'This was such a good thriller. I think it was one of the most effective ones that i have seen this year.It was defiantly a fun, hour and a half popcorn fun movie but i think it was just that little bit extra too. The filmmaking was above that for me. It just had that little bit of extra care put into it and i think it made all the difference.The acting was really great from both of the leads. I was really impressed with Kiera Allen. This was her debut film and i think this will net her even more roles because she was fantastic.I found the score really great too. It really worked together with the script and filmmaking to really get you into the film. I appreciated it.You should definitely watch this, its really fun, supper quick and well made.',\n",
       " \"This I can honestly say is not an overstatement. The movie contained everything it needed to be become a classic horror movie. It had gore, emotion,a few jumps,and action all the way through. The movie starts off well with the jumps and the pulse pounding action. Then all calms for a second, only to pick up again and faster.First off the gore was not as bad as some movies, which are overly gory for no reason. Don't get me wrong there was gore and lots of it, but for some reason it seemed to fit within the movie so well that your not really bothered by it. I'm no gore hound but I honestly couldn't turn away from the screen.The emotion is excellent for a horror film. Normally you get one dimensional characters, that do things that would never make sense whether panic stricken or not. In this film the emotions were well placed and not cheesy at all. There may have been one scene that went a little overboard but it didn't ruin a thing.The jumps were slight, and if your not a jumpy person you may not jump at all. But with all the action you'll still be on the edge of your seat, and the jumps to tell you truth are an added incentive.Finally the action was full on pulse pounding. It was incredible for a horror film. Think of the beginning scene of the Dawn of the Dead remake, but put it in the whole film, with a few chill spots with well placed acting. Honestly this movie deserves a 10 and has restored my faith in horror movies. I will be getting it on DVD and any directors cuts that may come out as well.\",\n",
       " \"How would we cope under the most extreme circumstances imaginable? That is the question posed by Danny Boyle's latest offering, and the answer seems to be that anybody can be pushed over the edge, it is just a question of what and how much it takes.Danny Boyle seems unable to settle on a genre specialty, but it also seems that whatever he turns his hand to he can make work (with the exception of romantic comedy - A Life Less Ordinary anyone?). In his latest, the sun is dying, and we join the 2nd attempt to try and restart the star by delivering a nuclear bomb to kick-start it. Having been alone in space for the past 16 months, the eight-man crew is approaching its destination, but nerves are starting to fray. Then they pick up a signal rom the ship that made the first, unsuccessful, attempt. Inevitably they go and investigate, and problems ensue. When the inevitable disaster occurs, jeopardising the mission, we begin to see how people deal with extreme circumstances, and how their sanity is affected, in different ways. Elements are recognisable from Alien, Solaris and Event Horizon, and the film certainly benefits from all of those influences. The claustrophobia, the understated technology, the dark corridors, the unseen menace, all recognisable but effectively used.This is not a typical science fiction per se. There are no aliens, no space battles, and no ultra-advanced technology on show. Instead Boyle chooses a more philosophical tangent, leading to questions of exactly what defines humanity, and the value of a single life weighed against the future of mankind.The casting is excellent, with many recognisable but no particularly famous faces, the biggest names being Batman Begins' Cillian Murphy and Fantastic Four's Chris Evans. This lack of star names, combined with a cast of only the eight crew somehow makes the loneliness and the feeling of being a huge distance from home with a long way to go seem even more real. We really begin to feel with the crew as they try to hold it together long enough to complete their vital mission. Cillian Murphy in particular is a piece of inspired casting, as in many of his roles he has always appeared on the very brink of insanity anyway, so he has the close-to-crazy act down to a tee.The CGI of the sun is extremely impressive, particularly considering the relatively low budget of the film, and the simple but intense story has viewers on the edge of the seat virtually from first act to last. The suspense is built gradually but extremely effectively, to the extent where you can feel your sanity heading the way of the astronauts' as the conclusion approaches with increasing speed.Overall a very effective study in what a tenuous thing sanity is when faced with huge odds and a great threat. Thrilling, gripping and thought-provoking, and another genre nailed by Boyle - now if only he could crack that pesky rom-com!\",\n",

       " \"After I've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times, but in it's genre it is a great movie. I know, not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' is turned into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with ... they are wrong. Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights. I have seen the original Robin Hood movies as well, but I never had such a good time when watching them as I had with this one. It's just one continuation of hilarious moments and parodies on famous people and movies (Winston Churchil, The Godfather...).I recommend everyone who wants to have a good laugh to watch this movie. To those who think Robin Hood shouldn't be messed with, you're wrong, but you better don't watch it because you'll probably be offended by it. I give this movie an 8/10.\",\n",
       " 'I am a Civil War \"buff,\" so I wanted to see this movie the moment I heard it was being made.  Yes, the New York Draft Riots did happen, just two weeks AFTER the Northern victory at Gettysburg, demonstrating that the outcome of the War was anything but certain, even after Lee had been forced to retreat to the south bank of the Potomac River.  Today, many would find this surprising.The movie did take some license, however.  There was no wholesale firing on civilians by Union soldiers.  In fact, reported deaths after three days of rioting were less than one-hundred.  Many of the dead were randomly selected blacks, who were hanged and mutilated (which was accurately depicted in the film).  Today, many would also find this surprising, because the schools teach that the North was good, and the South was bad.  The truth is that blacks were subjected to inhumane treatment everywhere, especially in the Nothern cities.There was also no firing by offshore naval vessels.  That was artistic license.  (My source for all of the above is a doctoral dissertation that was published about ten years ago titled \"The New York City Draft Riots.\")The movie makes the important point that the North had run out of \"home grown\" manpower to fight the South.  Had it not been for Irish and German volunteers through 1863, and black volunteers in 1864, the North would have sued for peace.  The 1864 Democratic Platform promised to bring the War to a swift and speedy conclusion.Bravo to Scorsese for bringing all of this to light.  In the meantime, the movie is about twenty minutes to long.  The brothel scenes, the \"uptown\" scenes, and some of the scenes in the catacombs struck me as slow and superfluous.  On the other hand, the street scenes and the scenes of the random gangs (of which I wish there were more) were glorious. \\nOne thing Scorsese left out, however:  The mountains of animal and human waste in the streets!  Not long after his movie was released, the History Channel produced a documentary on the Five Points area, and it is staggering to consider the tons and tons of animal and human waste piling up in the streets, and the thousands of gallons of urine running in the gutters. There were old photos of waste in the streets stacked six feet high. Needless to say, infant mortality in such a fetid environment was about 50%. Scorsese leaves this out, and there is scarcely a horse in the movie.Day-Lewis does a superb job with a character that is unevenly developed.  He is a homicidal thug in the beginning, a menacing, but somewhat benign, presence in the middle, and a psychotic killer in the end.  It isn\\'t really clear why he vacillates the way he does.  Bi-polar, I guess.  DiCaprio proves he can act, and he exudes a manliness he did not possess in earlier films.  Diaz turns in a creditable performance.  The cast of thousands adds a nice touch to the film.I would never say this is a \"great\" film, but it certainly is worth a look. Kudos to Scorsese for the herculean effort, and a tip of the kepi for the poetic ending, which reminded me of the ending in 1936\\'s \"San Francisco.\"',\n",
       " 'I walked into \"Crank\" with low expectations, as I do with many films. The previews made it look like it had a clever story, but I was worried that with Jason Statham playing lead, I might just get a re-hash of his \"Transporter\" films.I got a pleasant surprise. From the very beginning, the film moves. And moves damn fast. Not in an obnoxious way either. In the first minutes of the film we are set up with a possible story of corruption between hit men, a botched job, and the set-up for the whole movie-- Statham\\'s Chev Chelios being fatally poisoned with a Chinese-made serum that slows his heart rate, and will eventually literally make his heart stop, killing him. The only solution-- get the adrenaline pumping and keep his heart rate up! The whole movie is like one long action sequence, with pauses for story elements. This is the common thing now in films, but in other movies, it generally doesn\\'t work so well. But, with the premise of \"Crank\" being the need for speed (Literally), the idea of all-action, little-plot actually works. And works well.However, don\\'t be mistaken, there is genuine plot in the film. Clever stories about the pasts and workings of crime-lords and their cronies, and how they all relate to Chelios. Some of it went over my head because of the constant action, but I was able to understand everything enough to enjoy the film.The direction and editing is something I want to talk about briefly before I wrap this up. For a film like this, one would expect flashy camera work and crazy fast cutting, but I must say, the director/writer and the editor went beyond the call of duty. The film is shot as though the cameraman himself was the one who was poisoned, with the camera flashing and moving around nearly constantly, only settling during the slow scenes. Quite a genius use of camera-work to emulate the story. And the editing certainly adds a lot to the already excellent camera work. We get cutting when necessary and when not necessary, to further illustrate the needs of the main character.Overall, I would say \"Crank\" was the coolest movie I\\'ve seen in the last several years, leaps and bounds beyond the standard Hollywood action flick. I would recommend to any action-fan or adrenaline junkie, because take it from me, this film is the ultimate rush!',\n",
       " 'I had no high hopes when I walked into this film.  I like Will Smith, I like Martin Lawrence, so I figured this film will at least be funny.  And it was funny, and then some.  It was action packed, thrilling and a helluva good time.  I came out of the theatre thinking that the guy who directed that movie is going to be huge.Michael Bay, former music video and commercial director, has made an incredible directorial debut.  The film never stops.  When it isn\\'t action-packed, it is funny.  It is sexy, fun and always moving.  Christian Wagner\\'s editing is phenomenal.  I love action movies that really try to be action movies.  A lot of action films know that they are action films so they try to incorporate other genres to make the film more complete, but they often fail miserably.  They try so hard to be something they are not that they forget what they are in the first place. The essence of the action film is the action. It is a necessary component, it needs to be there otherwise it loses its edge. \"Bad Boys\" doesn\\'t just throw in the occassional action sequence to meet the expectations of the genre, but instead uses the action to help tell the story.  It is this use of filmmaking that allows an action film to remain an action film and still go beyond.Watch \"Bad Boys\" again and every time there is an action sequence, ask yourself why that was there and what did it accomplish.  You will find that each sequence took the film to another level; it introduced an new conflict, it increased the present conflict, it eliminated a key character, it introduced a new character, and so on.  There are a lot of action films out there that sacrifice story for spectacle, and the audience notices this.  At the centre of all films lies the story and if it comes to a halt so does the interest of the viewers.\"Bad Boys\" of course isn\\'t the greatest story on film, or even in the action genre, but what is so appealing and memorable about \"Bad Boys\" is that it is just as entertaining with its story as it is with its action by combining the two without sacrificing either.  Michael Bay understands the importance of the story within the structure of the film.  He tells a visual story, entertaining and complete, and leaves you very satisfied. Watch for Michael Bay because he is here to stay.',\n",
       " 'While I love horror films, I am not a big fan of the slasher genre, which has come to dominate and indeed practically to define horror since the late 1970s. While I do love the original \"Psycho,\" most slasher films follow a different, and far more predictable, formula. The idea of a faceless killer going around stabbing teenagers just doesn\\'t frighten me a whole lot, though some of these films do fill me with disgust--a rather different sort of emotion.I am far more frightened by films that deal with distortions of reality, where it\\'s hard for the characters to tell what\\'s real and what\\'s not. Admittedly, that genre isn\\'t always so lofty either. Dreams are one of the most overused devices in the movies, having a whole set of clichés associated with them. We are all familiar with the common scene in which a character awakens from a nightmare by jerking awake in cold sweat. This convention is not only overused, it\\'s blatantly unrealistic, for people waking up from dreams do not jerk awake in such a violent fashion. Moreover, these scenes are usually nothing more than little throwaway sequences designed to amuse or frighten the audience without advancing the plot.What makes \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" so clever is how it creates an entirely new convention for representing dreams on screen. The dreaming scenes are filmed with an airy, murky quality, but so are many of the waking scenes, making it very difficult to tell whether a character is awake or asleep. Indeed, the movie never shows any character actually fall asleep, and as a result we are constantly on guard whenever characters so much as close their eyes for a moment. In crucial scenes, it is impossible to tell whether what we are seeing is real or happening only in a character\\'s mind. But the movie ultimately suggests that the difference doesn\\'t matter. The premise of the movie, in which a child-killer haunts teenager\\'s dreams and has the capability of killing them while they\\'re asleep, turns the whole \"It was all just a dream\" convention on its head: in this movie, the real world is safe, and the dream world is monstrously dangerous.The movie finds a number of ways to explore this ambiguity, including a bathtub scene that invites comparisons with the shower scene in \"Psycho\" without being a cheap ripoff. My personal favorite scene, and one of the scariest I\\'ve ever seen in a movie, is the one where Nancy dozes off in the classroom while a student is standing up in front of the class reading a passage from Shakespeare. The way the scene transitions from the real classroom to a nightmarish version of it is brilliantly subtle.The director, Wes Craven, understood that the anticipation of danger is usually more frightening than the final attack. There are some great visual shots to that effect, including one where Freddy\\'s arms becomes unnaturally long in an alleyway, and another where the stairs literally turn into a gooey substance, in imitation of the common nightmare where it is hard to get away from a pursuer. The movie continually finds creative ways to tease the audience, never resorting to red herring, that tired old convention used in almost all other slasher films.Despite the creativity in these scenes, \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" is still a formula movie, with relatively one-dimensional characters and no great performances. This was Johnny Depp\\'s first role, as Heather Langenkamp\\'s boyfriend, and although he does get a few neat lines of exposition (his speech about \"dream skills\"), his personality is not fleshed out, and there is no sense of the great actor Depp would go on to become.Within the genre, however, \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" is a fine work. My main criticism isn\\'t its failure to transcend the formula, but its confusing and obtuse ending, apparently put there in anticipation of sequels, but managing to create a mystery that the sequels were unable to clear up. The climactic confrontation between Freddy and Nancy is weakly handled. The crucial words she says to him are surprisingly clunky, and her father\\'s muted behavior during that scene is almost inexplicable. It has led me to consider an alternative interpretation of the scene, but one that feels like a cop-out. The scene that follows, and where the movie ends, is anticlimactic and unnecessary. These clumsily-made final two scenes come close to ruining the movie, and it is a testament to the film\\'s many good qualities that it still stands as an unusually effective horror film that invites repeat viewings.',\n",
       " 'The days of Airplane and Naked Gun are over. Nowadays, we have the Scary Movies, Spy Hard, Date Movie, Not Another Teen Movie, etc....of all of these, Teen Movie is quite easily the best one. The point of spoofs and satires, to me, are not just to take familiar scenes and do something retarded and gross with them, but instead to actually make fun of all the things in the original movies that, while watching them, we all turned to our friends and said \"wait a minute, thats kind of stupid\". Teen Movie does this extremely well. How many of us lucky movie fans who saw She\\'s All That had trouble seeing why everyone in the movie thought the lead actress was ugly just because she had glasses and a ponytail? She was still a babe! How many of these teen movies give the main lead actress a friend who is clearly into her, but she always seems to ignore any possibility of romance between them, instead pursuing another character and asking for her friend\\'s help/advice? How many people thought the characters in Cruel Intentions were just sexually over the top to the point of being absurd? Teen Movie pokes great fun at all of these flaws. It is, unlike many other movies that attempt to be like it, a true satire, taking characters and not just doing stupid things with them, but exaggerating the traits of their serious counterparts and, when it comes down to it, just making fun of them. It has surprisingly good plot cohesion while still making fun of a variety of teen movies. I suppose the best way to distinguish this movie from all other modern spoofs is that this one is truly intelligent. Sure it has some stupid jokes, and toilet humor (that I admit I chuckled at in disgust like the diarrhea scene and the lesbian kiss with the old woman), but it also has some very clever jokes, like when is it appropriate to start a slow clap, why do these teen movies seem to only have one black character, and how silly is it that things slow down for emphasis when the beautiful female lead enters the room. Please, give this one a chance. If you\\'ve seen the other modern spoofs, I\\'m confident you will appreciate the noticeable and subtle differences between them and Teen Movie that make the latter much more enjoyable and palatable to watch.',\n",

       " 'It seems this movie has taken a bit of heat, known by many as Shyamalan\\'s \"worst\" film. It is often written off as slow moving, and the twist at the end as unoriginal and boring. I\\'ve heard people say the acting and camera work was awkward and stale and that the casting was poor. Ironically enough, as more people begin to dislike this movie, the more I seem to fall in love with it. This film has a lot of personal bearing with me, both as a student of psychology and a lover of movies and just plain art. I feel like I\\'ve taken this film under my wing during its times of criticism, and now I\\'d like to try and show everyone what exactly I love about it so much. Shyamalan really showed a stroke of brilliance by getting Serra to be his cinematographer and to play around with the aestetics of the film. I don\\'t know how or where Shyamalan is getting these guys for his movies, but I definitely love the style of each frame he shells out. Serra had been involved with predominately foreign films before Unbreakable. This was his first big American film, and I think you gotta give a little credit to Shyamalan for that. His unique and creative touch really added to the direction. In keeping with the \"comic book\" theme of the movie, you will notice that almost every shot is taken as if you are looking through or in between something. Like the squares of a comic strip. There is also a dark, slightly blue colored filter used throughout most of the film. This gives the movie a very bold, but eerie tone. Showing that the world can be a rough and scary place, but it can also be fought and overcome. It is evident that time and effort went into every shot. It may not slap many viewers in the face as brilliant, but it really strikes a chord with me. As for the score, I am more than willing to argue that this is, hands down, James Newton Howard\\'s best score of his very successful career. It is compelling and booming. It\\'s very powerful, but not over-the-top and excessive. For anyone with the soundtrack, check out \\'The Orange Man\\' and \\'Visions\\'. These are two of the most powerful pieces of any film score around. And I stress the word \"powerful\". Yeah, he\\'s no Hermann or Morricone, but the emotional weight and emotive power of his chords and his overall composition are just downright chilling. The writing and the direction are just as captivating as the score. Almost every line of dialogue and every scene seems to be placed out on an island, alone so that everyone can stop and judge it. Some people might view this as cocky and/or boring direction, but I see it as daring and unique. Much of Shyamalan\\'s writing is done that way. (\\'…I see dead people…\\' \\'...They call me Mr. Glass…\\' etc. etc.) Another aspect of the film that tickles my fancy is the underlying themes. I do believe, to a certain extent, that people do have somewhat supernatural powers at times. People have been known to make miracles and do unbelievable things. Maybe these things could be \\'developed\\' in some way. These theories are, in a way, intertwined with some aspects of psychology, such as selective attention and self-actualization. If you care to discuss some of these ideas, let me know and I will relate them to the film through my eyes. In short, I do believe there is a superhero in everyone. It may not be through supernatural powers, but it may simply be through the act of reaching out to a person in need. Other themes of the movie, like how completely different people can always be connected in some way and how everyone has their vulnerabilities and weaknesses are intriguing, yet universal. From a psychological point of view, Shyamalan really gets inside the head of OI patients (osteogenesis imperfecta). He then brings this psyche to the next level with Jackson\\'s character. Elijah, is very passionate but very tortured and evil. His interactions with Willis bring depth and focus to both the characters and the story. Certain scenes in the movie are really quite striking and powerful. The shots of Willis in his security poncho. The train station scene. Elijah\\'s breathtaking fall on the stairs and many more speak so loudly to me and say so much in just a simple clip. For some reason this movie just speaks to me, like art. If anyone cares to discuss more about this film, that\\'d be cool. There is a lotta other cool stuff to talk about with this movie. Just thinking about it makes me want to watch it a few more times. It may not be the feel good film of the year, or the masterpiece that everyone was looking for, but it definitely sits well with me.',\n",

       " '\"Zodiac\" may frustrate viewers who come to David Fincher\\'s latest film expecting a traditional serial killer thriller. The film begins with a couple of hair-raising and rather brutal recreations of murders carried out by the mysterious killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These early scenes are shocking and, compared to the rest of the film, disorienting, because they offer the only time that we come close to seeing events from the killer\\'s perspective. As the film progresses, the Zodiac killer himself fades into the background, and the movie turns into a meticulous and engrossing document of the investigation to track him down, an investigation that includes countless blind alleys and false clues and which to this day has not reached a conclusion. I would be more prone to label the somewhat rambling screenplay as sloppy storytelling if I did not feel that Fincher tells the story exactly as he wants to. The elusive narrative works, because the film is about an elusive villain.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist working for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" at the time the Zodiac killer began his gruesome work. He becomes fascinated by the case, and takes it on as a sort of morbid personal hobby long after the police department has given it up as a lost cause. Graysmith eventually wrote the book on which this film is based, and according to his accounts, he discovered enough evidence about one of the suspects in the case to put the police back on his trail years after he\\'d been cleared for lack of evidence. Other characters come and go. Robert Downey, Jr. does characteristically terrific work as a reporter at the \"Chronicle\" who grabs his own portion of notoriety through his involvement in the case. Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards play the two detectives in charge of the investigation. Chloe Sevigny plays Gyllenhaal\\'s put-upon wife, who gradually loses her husband to his obsession. All of the actors deliver thrilling performances, many of them against the odds. Since this isn\\'t a character driven movie, many of the characters remain undeveloped, but not, for once, to the detriment of the film. This story isn\\'t about the people involved, but rather about their role in the Zodiac saga; once they\\'ve served their purpose, Fincher dispenses with them. Ironically, a film that clocks in at nearly 3 hours exhibits a great deal of narrative economy.Parts of \"Zodiac\" are intensely creepy. Fincher effectively uses the rainy San Francisco atmosphere to its maximum potential, and the grimy browns and grays of the production design call to mind Fincher\\'s other well-known films, like \"Seven\" and \"Fight Club.\" But \"Zodiac\" is much more grown up than those films, and for an audience to enjoy it, it has to have an attention span. Long scenes are given to analyzing handwriting samples, recreating the scenes of murders, digging through newspaper clippings and files. You can tell that Fincher is fascinated by police work in the pre-CSI era, when fax machines were still a novel invention. He delves into the investigative process with a nearly fetishistic attention to detail, but he makes all of it endlessly mesmerizing. He does his best to bring everything to some sort of conclusion, but the real-life end to the story makes a complete conclusion impossible. This film is more about the journey than the destination, and what a journey it is.Grade: A',\n",

Those particular exploits cursed the family's men to many an ill-fated turn.  It is during just such a turn that we meet Stanley IV.  He has been accused, falsely, of stealing a pair of baseball shoes, freshly donated to a homeless shelter auction, by a famous baseball player.  He is given the option of jail, or he can go to a character building camp.  `I've never been to camp before,' says Stanley.  With that the Judge enthusiastically sends him off to Camp Green Lake.Camp Green Lake is an odd place, with an odd philosophy, `If you take a bad boy, make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun, it will turn him into a good boy.'  We learn this little pearl of wisdom from Mr. Sir (John Voight) one of the camp's `counselors.'  We get the impression right away that he is a dangerous man.  He at least wears his attitude honestly; he doesn't think he is nice.  The camp's guidance councilor, Mr. Pendanski (Tim Blake Nelson) is a different matter entirely.  He acts the part of the caring sensitive counselor, but he quick, quicker than anyone else in authority to unleash the most cruel verbal barbs at his charges.  The Warden has a decided capacity for meanness, but other than that she is a mystery.  These three rule Camp Green Lake, a place that has no lake.  It is just a dry dusty desert filled with holes, five feet deep and five feet wide.  Its local fauna, seem only to be the vultures, and dangerous poisonous yellow-spotted lizards.  Green Lake seems is, in many ways, a haunted place.Holes works in spite of the strange setting, and the strange story, because it understands people.  Specifically because it is honest in the way it deals with the inmates of Camp Green Lake.  The movie captures the way boys interact with one another perfectly.  It captures the way boys can bully each other, they way they can win admiration, the way they fight with one another, and the way boys ally themselves along the age line.  It is this well nuanced core that makes everything else in the film believable. What is also refreshing about this film the good nature of its main character. He does not believe in a family curse, he is not bitter about the infamous exploits of his `no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.' In fact he loves hearing the story.  Stanley IV is not bitter about the past, and determined not let it affect him in the way it has affected his father and grandfather.  There is at times a lot of sadness in the film, but not a lot wallowing angsty silliness.  And that is refreshing.\\nHoles is an intelligent, insightful and witty family movie.  It entertains, and not in any cheap way.  It is not a comedy, though it has its laughs. It dares to be compelling, where many family movies tend to play it safe and conventional.  As such it transcends the family movie genera and simply becomes a good film that everyone can enjoy. I give it a 10.\",\n",
       " \"Though this film fits the coming of age genre the struggles that Nadine, the main character, is going through are not purely 'teen problems', As a 20 something year old this film deeply resonated with me and though similar to Nadine I was a socially awkward, defensive and pessimistic teenager it wasn't just the teenage me who could find the character relatable. I've noticed in the low rated comments one of the main reasons people didn't like the film is because the main character isn't likeable. And though I loved the film, I would agree; she isn't likeable. And the film is more realistic and better off for it. In real life we aren't always likeable people ourselves and the film almost acts as a tool to allow us to step back and really look at our current or teenage selves. Nadine does realise and understand towards the end and throughout the film her erratic and selfish behaviour is a result of her self loathing because she knows she doesn't want to continue being that way but she's stuck in this endless cycle and doesn't know how to get out. The valuable lesson from the film and her journey within it is that we often bring misfortune and unhappiness on ourselves in the way we handle and respond to bad things in our lives. I think this film will speak to anyone who has felt alone in the world, lost without purpose or anywhere to fit in. If you like films about people rather than action and you watch a film to be taken on a journey (albeit an emotional one) rather than to have an enjoyable couple of hours then this may be the film for you. It helps that is has an excellent cast, each actor fitting their roles well and bringing them to life.Another positive note I took away from the film is the way it handles and represents mental illness/ distress as it does so without labels and in a subtle way without needing to bring it to the forefront.\",\n",

If I had not paid so much for my ticket, I would have gotten up and left halfway through the movie. IT IS AWFUL! It is astonishing to me that this generation finds a movie this horribly scripted, filmed, and thought-out to be good. It is not controversial, racy, or thought- provoking. It gives no insight, message, or underlying theme. It isn\\'t that I do not like controversial, bad-ass, or vulgar films.. I do. This film offered none of that!

No superstar cast to carry it yet it still delivers.It won't make everyone happy and that is okay since most good movies will do something well instead of trying to please everyone. That is the one thing that stood out to me, don't try to do everything mediocre.I think this being a peacock exclusive is going to be the biggest thing going against it since it limits the audience.\",\n",
       " 'I went into the theater not knowing what to expect, not having seen the trailer, and two hours later I felt I had seen a decent movie, quite funny at times, but I couldn\\'t figure out what everyone was making such a big deal about. Compared to a lot of what passes for comedy in the cinema these days, Knocked Up is great, but it\\'s hardly the \"instant classic\" that I\\'ve seen it called in many professional and IMDb reviews. It\\'s certainly worth seeing, but maybe at a discount matinée instead of a full-price evening show.Much of what is wrong with Knocked Up is simply an over-reliance on Seth Rogen to deliver the laughs. To be sure, Rogen is a funny guy - he handled the jump from second-tier supporting actor (a la 40 Year Old Virgin) to leading man surprisingly well, appearing confident and charismatic. The problem is that as the film goes on, he just doesn\\'t get a whole lot to work with from his supporting cast. Rogen doesn\\'t have enough in him at this point to carry an entire film on his shoulders, but often he is forced into that role, providing the only humor in many scenes (especially in the second half of the movie). At times it almost seems as if Rogen has landed in the wrong film, delivering clever quips and laughs while the barely-likable characters around him remain too serious. Paul Rudd manages to break this up, taking some of the burden off Rogen, but Katherine Heigl and Leslie Mann\\'s unfunny and quasi-sympathetic characters drag them down.To be sure, the first half of Knocked Up is great, but by the second half the script becomes mired in slow, cliché drama. Marital dissatisfaction and the loss of youth are interesting themes to explore, but in doing so, Knocked Up fails to establish a consistent tone. As the film trudges past the 90-minute mark, it is sometimes humorous, sometimes dour, often clichéd, all resulting in an awkward mix of styles.Overall, Knocked Up was a good effort, but a little more editing of the script would have helped a lot. I don\\'t mind long movies at all, but 20 minutes could have been trimmed from this film to good effect.',\n",
       " 'You\\'ll have to excuse me and some of the other proponents of \\'National Lampoon\\'s Animal House\\' if we seem a little defensive about the movie. That\\'s because it\\'s often not recognized as the superior comedy classic that it is.  Instead, too often it is lumped in with the multitude of inferior films that it inspired, which is totally unfair.Some of the conventional wisdom about \\'Animal House\\' is absolutely right, though. John Belushi does give a bravura performance that is reminiscent of the great comics before him like Chaplin, Keaton (Buster, not Michael), the Marx Brothers, etc., and he does it with a wonderful economy of words. His character of \"Bluto\" Blutarsky is often emulated and imitated but many times the persons doing so have no idea what it was that made him and his performance so great.Tim Matheson as \"Otter\" and his other frat house buddies were also prototypes that were much imitated too, and again often without success. Otter was the quintessential smooth talker, always working an angle on everybody, especially the ladies. When a woman tells him that his lovemaking wasn\\'t that great, he cocks his head, points a finger at himself and mouths the words, \"not great?\" in mock disbelief. Before Tom Hanks got \"Big\" he made a career out of playing this character. Also John Vernon set a standard for straight men with his portrayal of the beleaguered Dean Wormer, plagued by his \"zoo fraternity.\"Not all of the movie\\'s humor aims low, by any means; some of it is quite sophisticated. (Yes, you read it right.) The screenwriters and director John Landis did a great job evoking Kennedy-era America and they found a lot to laugh at. This comedy is an unqualified classic by the simplest definition-- it makes you laugh, long and loud.',\n",

       " \"Its hard to know where to start with such a breathtaking film. Oliver Stone's Platoon is quite simply the best Vietnam war film ever made in my opinion. Everything about it is as close to perfection as we are likely to see. Charlie Sheen plays the lead, and Willem Defoe and Tom Berenger play the two sergeants that form a key part of the plot.Chris Taylor (Sheen) is torn between the sergeants. Barnes (Berenger) is the battle hardened, brutal murderer, who uses the war as an excuse to tender to his sadistic pleasures. Elias (Defoe) is the other side of the spectrum. We get the sense that he has wrestled with his inner demons, but he has successfully come through to the other side. He has compassion for his fellow man, and he uses drugs as a form of escapism from this brutal war. The two symbolise the struggle that Taylor must face if he is to survive out in Vietnam.Oliver Stone perfectly captures war. The shooting is frantic and impossible to follow. It perfectly disorientates us, just as the soldiers were. We have no idea who is being shot at, and neither do they. We follow the war at ground level, and see the brutalities first hand. Having served in Vietnam, the film is loosely based on Stone's time out there, and Taylor loosely based on himself.Full Metal Jacket showcases how inhumane the war was, Apocalypse Now turns it into a story about life in general, and hopelessness, but Platoon has everything. Trying hard to avoid the old cliché, but if you only watch one war film, make sure it is this one. Nothing else can come close.\",\n",

From out of nowhere, the characters involved suddenly had an interest for one another? Without any build up of it in past movies nor in this one, it just felt empty.Camera angles that were purposefully shot for the intentional thrill of 3D is like any other angles used in any other 3D-movie-going-experience.

       " '\"Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri\" marks a milestone for writer/directer Martin McDonagh and is an idea piece on a mother\\'s struggle with her town after posting billboards containing a call to action in regards to her murdered daughter. With outstanding screen writing and near perfect editing, this powerhouse of a film is easily one of the best all year and is driven with force and intensity by its lead, Frances McDormand.What begins as a narrow and focused drama, gradually escalates to a film with big themes and ideas, relevant social commentary, and much more subplots than anticipated. \"Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri\" is packed with questions and a few answers about anger, revenge, violence, and kindness. The story shows people in a realistic light I\\'ve never quite seen before. We\\'re presented with characters and their genuine emotions. Nothing feels sugarcoated of fluffed but it never lacks emotional impact either. The movie balances its seemingly contradictory tones beautifully by crafting a dark comedy that feels heavy due to strong subject matter, while at the same time, utilizing comedic moments that feel completely natural to the character\\'s motivations. It\\'s obvious great care was taken into this script and the method in which it\\'s constructed. One of the most talked about elements to this film are the strong performances; particularly by Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. Rightfully so, this is some of their best (if not their best) work these eyes have beheld and they steal the show in every film they\\'re in. That\\'s not take away from Woody Harrelson and Lucas Hedges, as well as the entire cast who give memorable performances and paint shockingly believable characters that we feel we know personally. If there is anything that might turn audiences away from this film, it might be its harsh subject matter despite none of it every being depicted as well as its language and execution with the material. Personally, this has a strong impact and I wouldn\\'t have changed anything about it. It\\'s a highly recommended film with a lot to ponder at the end and is definitely a contender for best movie of the year. Definitely don\\'t miss this one.',\n",

The look of it all, the setting, the wardrobe, the exterior, the actors themselves, and then, worst of all, their acting.It's just all bad and not at all right.None of it seems normal.Certainly not believable.In film, we have to believe.Buy in.Even in horror movies.Especially in horror movies.I knew that though a mere hour and a half, from the start, with the way this was going, it was going to be a long, long, loooong haul.A fantastic three hour epic can seem like a viral clip.A bad, short movie like this can seemingly go on for centuries.One day I'll want this 90 minutes and five seconds back.All of it.So, an oddly-dressed family with perfectly combed hair looking freshly-showered living out of an outdated RV on vacation during a quite chilly time of year (you can see their breath in conversation) as they picnic outside, is encountered by, yikes, two guys in an old truck speaking with southern accents (but of course!)\\nThese two guys speak and say things nobody would ever say, ever to strangers, much less a family, and the patriarch in turn reacts how no one would ever react.Later, they meet again, and more of this awkward interaction continues but this time one of the inexplicably, physically dirty rednecks has a shotgun and they're blocking the road.Why?Because this is stupid and it's doing what's been done before but this time, worse, and again, totally not believable.But, you won't believe this, more bad decisions occur.And we're not even fifteen minutes in.And then there's a twist.,\\nAnd it gets the stupid to a whole 'nother ridiculous and grotesque level.It's cute for a minute, but just a minute.Then it's back to dumb and even dumber.Who writes this stuff?This seems real to you?Oh, and there's even a lengthy musical interlude.Yay.I love a recital injected into the midst of all my horror movies!You have to ask at some point in some movies, why?Why is this happening?Or, as in here, why is any of this happening?Why are the characters doing what they are doing?And in this movie, it just doesn't make any sense.Any of it.There is a beautiful love scene. A love scene? I know. But it is, and that is the only reason this garbage movie gets rated as high as it does.This movie wants to be clever but it's not for all the reasons that I mentioned.Aside from the amazing make out session there is nothing here except frustration and boredom.This is one of the worst, if not the worst streaming films of 2024.Take the high road.

       " \"The story of the Kray twins is a fascinating one, full of violence and deceit. In Legend, that story isn't really taken to its full potential, thanks to an unfortunately clunky structure despite brilliant performances, good humour and violence.Let's start with the best part of this film, that is Tom Hardy's performances as Ronnie and Reggie Kray. The amazing special effects make the dual show possible, but within minutes of the start here, you completely forget that these two characters are played by the same man.Hardy completely disappears into both men, with an unnerving but humorous turn as the psychotic Ronnie, and a more understated but powerful performance as Reggie, and that really deserves some praise.What's more is that this film does make use of the very violent nature of the history very well. As bloody as it is foul-mouthed, this isn't a pleasant film to watch, but the level of violence does leave an impression with regards to the Krays' crimes, making it seem all the more real, and all the more frightening.The big issue I have with this film, however, is that it's not an exhilarating watch. Historically interesting it may be, but at over two hours long, it's not something that will consistently entice you throughout.There are side plots that aren't picked up on enough, some characters don't get the development they really deserve based on the size of their role, and the plot takes a really long time to get going.The disappointing thing is that Legend isn't a bad film in any way, nor is it boring, but it gives you a sense of growing importance and tension towards a hopefully climactic end, but it never comes as you want it to.\",\n",
       " 'I feel like sometimes great movies don\\'t get enough recognition, films like Prisoners, Enemy, or Predestination. This film impacted me heavily, and it kept me thinking and thinking about it for a week after I saw it. Ethan Hawke gave a great performance, which keeps me wondering why he ever agreed to do \"The Purge\", but the real standout is Sarah Snook, who is breathtaking in her role.One of the best things about this film was that when I thought it was going in one direction, it took a hard right hand turn. Not many movies make me doubt myself like that. The direction was clean and solid, the cinematography was immaculate, and the special and visual effects were outstanding. Everything about the look of the film was perfect.My only complaints are that the movie\\'s first act was a little slow. However, as the film progresses into the second and third act, the long first act is absolutely necessary. If it was a little shorter, it would\\'ve worked so well. Confusing? Yes. Enjoyable?

       " \"I read through a few of these reviews and the general analysis seemed to be that this movie sucks more than the lead character does in the back room of the Cheetah Club. Well, I guess if you take it at face value, it does.\\nHowever, it's not meant to be taken that way (internally, with a glass of water?), and it's a shame that so many people did. Really, 'Showgirls' is a campy, funny movie. It's a riot. And it's supposed to be.Elizabeth Berkley, in the lead role, plays her part like an actress on one of those day-time soaps - which is probably exactly what Verhoeven wanted. She does everything dramatically. She sits down, dramatically; she takes off her jacket, dramatically; and if you watch closely enough you'll even see her eating fries dramatically.Gina Gershon as femme fatale/lead dancer Cristal gives the best performance of the film. She obviously is in sync with the director and has a lot of fun with the part, and if you only watch it for one reason, watch it for her. Because, in the words of L'Oreal, she's worth it. She's a great talent and it's a shame she's not recognised more widely.Would I recommend it? I don't know. It depends on your taste. If you're looking for a drama, go elsewhere. If you're looking for a quirky, funny movie, and you don't mind lots of naked ladies running around all over the place (yes, even if you're female - I am, and I liked it), go rent it.

       " \"This is not strictly-speaking an adaption of Erich Maria Remarque's classic. A few minor incidents from the novel are included, but Remarque's biggest contribution to this film is the title. Given the ending of the film (as opposed to the book) the title is somewhat misleading, but it's such a classic that the film-makers' decision is quite understandable.This is a brutal and uncompromising study of the realities of war. The fact the the war depicted took place more than a hundred years ago doesn't make it any less relevant. It could be shown in Ukraine today, and soldiers on both sides would understand.Nor is the film's anti-war message terribly new. It is, however, a message that needs to be repeated over and over again, until (maybe) enough people take it seriously.The battle scenes are appallingly visceral - possibly the best of their type since the opening of Saving Private Ryan.The history of any war is written by the winners, but that doesn't stop them being a tragedy for the poor grunts on the losing side as well.\",\n",
       " 'I have recently been seeing a psychiatrist about a few troubles. In one of his sessions, he bought up about the movie Cruel Intentions, which I absolutely loved. He said he loved the start of the movie where the evil Sebastian says to the Psychologist `You have beautiful legs, I would love to photograph them\\'. This then sets the tone for one of the best teen films that the world has seen. Based on the movie Dangerous Liaisons, Cruel Intentions goes down as one of my top five favourite films of all-time.A sex-obsessed rich boy Sebastian sets out to win his greatest \"conquest\" - a girl who has proclaimed in a Teen magazine that she will wait until marriage to lose her virginity. The teen is egged on by his sister, Catherine, an evil scheming girl in her own right. The two have a wager on whether Sebastian can achieve his conquest. If he wins, he gets a night of bliss with his stepsister, if she wins, she keeps his most prided possession, his Jaguar convertible!Well this is a brilliant backstabbing, bitchy, love and hate war movie. I cannot remember a movie like it in my time. The theme of the movie was priceless. Having two rich hobnob kids toying with various people\\'s emotions in their neighborhood was just great. In fact it is not at all silly to think that this does not happen in real life, because if you don\\'t believe that then you are very naïve. There are many people who need to be praised for this classic movie. Director Roger Kumble did a great job in bringing this movie to our screens. He added so many little `steamy\\' pieces to this movie that it was never going to fail. Then you have the producer Neal H. Moritz who also allowed this film to shine. He gave this film all the right production touches, which I can only praise.Then you have the wonderful cast that was assembled for Cruel Intentions. The main star for this film would have to be the gorgeous Sarah Michelle Gellar. She was outstanding as the horrible Catherine. Her character while at times was extremely hard to like, she was almost too hard to not want to like. I mean she was every guy\\'s fantasy. Sexually liberated (and not afraid to admit it), then all she wanted to do is screw up all her enemies at the same time. Then you have the patronising and \\x91stud man\\' Sebastian, played by Hollywood hunk Ryan Philippe. His performance in this film was also first class. I thought his character was a lot more likable then Catherine\\'s, but you could sometimes want to strangle him for the way he screws with people, just like his stepsister does, and then still seemingly gets more women dying to be with him. Other cast members just help to make this film an extraordinary viewing experience. Reese Witherspoon is fantastic as the pure and innocent, Annette. She helps to balance the sour bitchy side of the cast, with her friendly almost sickening goody goody side. I am looking forward to seeing Witherspoon in the comedy, Legally Blonde, directed by new Australian director Robert Luketic. Selma Blair was also very good in her role as the dumb and very naïve Cecil. The kissing scene that she has with Gellar was one of the highlights of the film, with the kiss being voted the best onscreen kiss a few years ago.Then this film has another great side to it, that of the soundtrack. It has so many great songs on it. Placebos tune `Every me, Every you\\' helps start this movie off, then you get songs such as Colorblind by Counting Crows and the classy, Bitter Sweet Symphony, by the Verve. This would have to be one of the world\\'s most popular soundtracks from where I view it.In conclusion, Cruel Intentions is a film I can say I love and that I can learn from. People in real life do use people and do hurt them. I know this because I was involved in such a scenario not so long ago. Nothing was ever happy until it was a fight and scrag. I will go as far to admit that I was confronted with a real life Catherine, a person who was such a goody goody on the outside, but the real person on the inside is a person that loves to cause trouble and will go out of her way to do it. Anyone who is like that is a real low-life in my view. Get swept up in the nasty love triangle, \\x91Cruel Intentions\\'!Rating: 5 Stars or 10/10',\n",
       " 'I was 11 when the first Star Wars movie came out. I wasn\\'t mature enough to appreciate Harrison Ford\\'s space-cowboy smirk or Carrie Fischer\\'s sarcasm, much less the swagger of their respective deliveries. All I cared about was robots blasting other robots.By the time The Matrix hit theaters in 1999, we had seen enough action-packed sci-fi over the years to make us cringe. Our demands had increased exponentially.We now expect both a story as well as the actors\\' performance to retain some amount of integrity. If this is missing, no amount of kicking or shooting can rid us of the feeling that we\\'ve just been wasting our time in a way that was only acceptable when we were 11.In light of all the negative reviews on Reloaded, I tried not to expect too much. Still, I paid a whopping $9.00 at the box-office of a top-notch theater equipped with the beefiest sound system in town. During and after, I felt embarrassed for having done so.I was given the distinct impression that Andy and Larry themselves had never even seen The Matrix.Reloaded is an entirely different film from The Matrix. It reeks of a sell-out, of board rooms filled with brainstorming marketing-scammers, of a colossal rip-off that seems to have forgotten what Generation X liked most about The Matrix: its atmospheric flair.In The Matrix, we\\'re taken on a post-modern coming-of-age journey with Neo. In Reloaded, it\\'s not Neo, but CGI that\\'s the focus of the film.Reloaded is nothing more than a full-length feature COMPUTER GAME. So why not just go play one?The Matrix was a slick and suspenseful FILM, in which the viewer identified with the underdogs\\' characters. We rejoiced when they overcame. But Reloaded lacks any treatment of the protagonist\\'s development, or anyone else\\'s for that matter, allowing the viewer to identify with the plight of no-one.The Matrix closed out with a pounding tune by Rage Against the Machine, who scream \"Fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy!!!\" So what happened to this perspective?It\\'s Invasion of the Body Snatchers: The original writers were replaced by 14-year-old computer geeks more eager to escape into the arms of a voluptuous, blonde computer program than they are in making a film.Reloaded is so pristinely sterile, odorless, emotionless, CHARACTER-less, and at times so pubescently vulgar, it\\'s hard to believe these are the same writers.This affects even the best of actors. It\\'s disheartening to see the Othello of The Matrix reverse roles with Keanu in respect of acting quality.Fishburne\\'s droning recital of horrific, pseudo-intellectual musing is so stilted, you can almost hear the director urging him to be \"More serious, Laurence! You\\'ve got to be more Morpheus than Morpheus himself ever knew he was!\"Further criticisms include:---Actions sequences too clean (i.e. retouched) and drawn-out. Suspense is lost;---CGI used far too often to smooth over gaps in bullet-time photography. The least trained eye easily spots Gumby-like cartoon drawings stretching across the screen;---Acting and writing brutally stilted. Offends the most ill-equipped intellect. One has the impulse to ignore the dialog completely as a means of punishing it, like parents deliberately not reacting to a 10-year old who tries to shock them with foul language. Misguided attempts at 10th-grade level pop-philosophy add to superficiality;---The direction the story takes views like a made-for-TV Stargate spin-off with an all-new no-name cast. Story and characters are hideously compromised, amateurishly convoluted;---Nothing short of fury is generated by what sloppy writing did to Agent Smith (now a renegade evil hippie-bot on a soul-search, seeking revenge for reasons frighteningly lacking depth) and the Oracle (now trivialized by meandering, contrived oracle-speak, reduced to a pseudo-smarmy program, a side-act as opposed to the pithy element she was). These two key characters are robbed of their sovereignty and depth;---Sets in Zion are too Hollywood, mat-drawing or CGI. Costumes are straight out of Star Trek the Next Generation or a Calvin Klein commercial for Woodstock-copycat wannabe ravers. This contrasts harshly with underdog Matrix-hackers all wearing moth-eaten sweaters on the Nebuchadnezzar vis-a-vis Zion mission control\\'s immaculate, glaring white, state-of-the-art hi-tech garb. Overload of scenes with superfluous counsels and commanders who all have something TERRIBLY important to say;---Twins are pubescently extravagant disco-albino Casper-the-Ghost punching bags. The freeway chase scene is among the most drawn-out sequences; leaves one addled, apathetic;---We anticipated seeing \"the minds Neo freed\" and how Neo does this more than anything, far more than him rescuing himself and his pals. The writers completely ignore this.In sum:This movie has nothing to do with the original, where it left off, or its \\'message\\'.We overestimated the Wachowski Bros. when we hoped they would present a follow-up that would hold true to \\'what it means\\' to be an underdog, hack a Matrix or rage against a machine.The Bros. need to rewind to scenes where Carrie-Anne Moss delivers lines from the back seat of a suicide-door Caddy in the rain: \\'You\\'ve been down that road Neo...\\', or Laurence Fishburne\\'s \\'I suspect that right about now you\\'re feeling a bit like Alice ... tumbling down the rabbit hole\\'. The feeling scenes like those evoked is long lost. Instead, the Bros. just reload and regurgitate on us, CGI-style.Talents of accomplished actors are squandered. The actors themselves come across brow-beaten by lousy script-writing until performances are all less than equal to Keanu\\'s robotics.Between 1999 and 2003, the Bros. seem to have forgotten what it means to rock like underdogs.Maybe it\\'s because the dollar signs on their eyes have blinded them. Reloaded not only abandons its own previously postulated truth ... that \"there is no spoon\" ... it now INSISTS there is one, and promptly proceeds to ram it down our throats.',\n",

No pin-point accuracy with 19th century technology, no desire to 'play fair' and face the enemy on even terms.  If you can shoot him in the back...then do it.Eastwood puts in an astonishing performance as the retired killer Muny, saved from his life of thievery and murder by his late wife.  Now, desperately trying to support his children with no income, he is tempted back to his killing ways by the bounty offered by the women of a brothel, one of whom's number has been savagely beaten and disfigured by a drunken ranch-hand.The film follows Eastwood as he wrestles with his desire to honour his wife's memory and his need to feed his children by returning to the killer that, he fears, is his true nature.  Meanwhile word of the bounty has spread and the events spiral out of control as the sheriff (Gene Hackman) deals with the guns for hire that ride into town.While all the supporting cast are excellent Gene Hackman's Oscar winning performance even manages to eclipse Eastwoods as the brutal Sheriff. He beats one of the bounty hunters, English Bob (Richard Harris) almost to death and then explains to a journalist, in one of the film's stand out scenes, how men like he and Muny are so successful at killing. The mood moves from light banter to life threatening seriousness...and back again, with just one move of his head.One of the greatest Westerns ever made?  Certainly. Although the fact it's a western is really secondary.  In truth it's a tale of the nature of evil and the nature of man.  Eastwood uses the gap between the western myth and reality as an arena to play out his story and does so with consummate style.\",\n",
